Stuff we need to do:

1) Admin can destroy users

Leftover from previous iteration. User story should be easy to write and pass.

2) Map of Nigeria

For now, our user story will pass by just having some text on the page indicating there is a map. Actual map -- we debated between a "homegrown" map vs. Google Maps API. We agreed everyone should look into both options this week to figure out which path was best.

3) List of articles vs location 

Chris already created the Article migration, and we debated whether or not Location itself needed to be a model, or would it be sufficient as an attribute. Some things we considered if Location had its own model:

-an event only has one location
-does an article only has one location? 

Not particularly sure how the user story will work here.

4) Figure out webscraper

Richard says there's a gem for this. I assume this is our highest priority right now, so everyone should look into this. Not sure how the user story will work here.
