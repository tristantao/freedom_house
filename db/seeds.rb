Through e-mails to journalists, the group is now demanding Christians convert to Islam and denies government claims that peace talks are underway. Violence in Plateau State Many parts of Nigeria’s Plateau State are on lockdown after a weekend of violence.  Deputy Superintendent of Police Abuh Emmanuel says four local governments have 6 a.m. to 12 p.m. curfews, leaving the people only six hours a day outside their homes. He blames ethnic Fulani herdsmen, who are mostly Muslim, for raiding villages over the weekend and later attacking a funeral for the victims of the earlier raids. The victims were mostly ethnic Berom Christian farmers and the two groups have been at odds over resources for years. Fulani leaders deny orchestrating the attacks, calling the accusations “propaganda.” ​​However, as a tense calm returns to the region, the Islamist sect known as Boko Haram has claimed responsibility for the funeral attack, saying Christians should convert or they “will not know peace again.” Abubakar Umar Kari, a senior lecturer at the University of Abuja, says Boko Haram’s involvement was a surprise as the group normally operates far in the north. “Boko Haram has a very long reach," he said. "It has shown that it is capable of carrying out devastating attacks.  It appears to have no bounds.” Killing in raids, funerals Death tolls for the weekend's violence range widely, but at least 58 people were killed in raids on Saturday and at least 22 killed at the subsequent funerals on Sunday, including two Plateau state politicians, Senator Gyang Dantong and Gyang Fulani, the majority leader in the state assembly. Human Rights Watch has said Boko Haram violence can intensify ethnic clashes because economic and ethnic ties also fall squarely along religious divides. Boko Haram communicates with the public by calling journalists from blocked phone lines or unverifiable e-mails. In the latest e-mail, the group called Nigeria’s new National Security Adviser Sambo Dasuki's claims to have initiated peace talks with Boko Haram a “fresh lie.” Secrecy Kari says Boko Haram operates in secrecy and even if the security adviser was engaged in dialogue with the group, Boko Haram would most likely publicly deny it. “They don’t want any kind of publicity associated with any meeting between them and the federal government," said Kari. "So I would not be surprised that even if there have been moves to talk to them - if there have been some rapprochements from the government’s side - they won’t come out too quickly to confirm it.” Sectarian dispute Nigeria is divided between a mostly Muslim north and a predominantly Christian south. Increasing violence in the “Middle Belt” regions have led some cities like Jos, the capital of Plateau State, to divide themselves in kind, with Muslims and Christians saying they cannot live together. Human Rights Watch says more than 4,000 people have been killed in sectarian violence over the past 11 years in Plateau State. Boko Haram began violent operations in 2009, and has since been blamed for more than 1,000 deaths including attacks on security forces, government buildings, churches, schools, newspaper offices and the local United Nations headquarters in the Nigerian capital, Abuja.}},

Ningi, who spoke to our correspondent in Uyo, venue of the Senate Retreat on Tuesday, said the violent group had not been selective in their targets, saying many Muslims, including his uncle, had been killed by Boko Haram. He said, “I am a victim of Boko Haram. My uncle was killed by the sect; he was a former Deputy Inspector-General of Police. “So, if people are saying that because you are Hausa, Muslim or a northerner and that you are in sympathy with the activities of the sect, I will say it is not true. “If it is true that we are in sympathy with the sect, how come the statistics on the ground shows that more Muslims have been killed in the attacks by the sect than the Christians?” The lawmaker added, “What we as senators from the North should do at this retreat is to make our southern counterparts know that the Boko Haram has a different belief from other muslims. What they preach and do is beyond our understanding and conclusion. This sect is more dangerous than any security agencies by going after those who talk against them.” Meanwhile, the Action Congress of Nigeria National Chairman, Chief Bisi Akande, hailed the retreat, saying it was capable proffering solutions to the lingering security challenges in the country.}},

JUNGLE JOURNALIST reliably gathered that some of these messages are targetd at deriding the governmnet of President Goodluck Jonathan, whom it describes as Nyamiri, a derisive word meaning Igbos among Northerners. Other subject matters include the mandate of the Koran to ‘kill, or injure’Christians, while the other is geared at praising the activities of some Federal ministers, or government functionaries, whom they see as their heroes as they are from Northern Nigeria and have engaged in pro-Boko Haram policies.  Some of these texts have repeatedly spoken about mass killings which they plan to carry out against all Christians in no distant time. It also speaks of the splitting of Nigeria into six nations.

Muhammadu Buhari (rtd) in which he allegedly predicted bloodshed in 2015 and labelled the Federal Government led by President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, as "the biggest Boko Haram". But perhaps the most unfortunate part of the statement was the portion in which Buhari said that, "Since the leaders now don’t listen to anybody but do whatever they wish, there is nothing the north can do." We find it very sad that an elder statesman who once presided over the entirety of Nigeria can reduce himself to a regional leader who speaks for only a part of Nigeria. We now understand what his protégé and former Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Malam Nasir El’Rufai, meant when he wrote in a public letter in October of 2010, telling Nigerians that Buhari remains "perpetually unelectable" and that Buhari's "insensitivity to Nigeria’s diversity and his parochial focus are already well-known." Who can know Buhari better than his own political associate? Come to think of it, as the CPC presidential candidate in the 2011 election, how many states in the Federation did he visit to campaign for votes? Buhari never bothered to campaign in the southern part of the country and consistently played up the North-South divide to the chagrin of patriotic and well-meaning Nigerians. As the results revealed, Nigerians will never vote for anyone who wants to divide the country. Is Buhari going to continue to be a sectional leader? The Federal Government led by President Jonathan is not Boko Haram. Boko Haram means Western Education is sin. That being the case, one wonders how a government that devoted the largest sectoral allocation in the 2012 budget to education could be said to be Boko Haram. Between 1983, when Buhari forcefully seized power from the democratically elected administration of President Shehu Usman Shagari, and 2012, no other administration has committed the same quantum of resources as the Jonathan administration to education in the part of Nigeria that has witnessed the most Boko Haram-related insecurity. Only on April 10, 2012, President Jonathan commissioned the first of 400 Federal Government Model Almajiri Schools, equipped with modern facilities such as a Language Laboratory, Qur'an Recitation Hall, classrooms and dormitories as well as a clinic, vocational workshop, dining hall and quarters for the Mallams. As Nigerians read this, more of such schools have been completed. We now challenge Major General Buhari (rtd) to tell Nigerians what he has done, whether in his capacity as the head of a military junta or in his private capacity, to bring education to vulnerable children. If he cannot live up to this challenge, perhaps he has to reassess who really is Boko Haram. Buhari claims that the Federal Government does not listen. Such an accusation ought not to emanate from a man overthrown by his own hand- picked colleagues in the military for refusing to listen to advice and behaving as if he had a monopoly of knowledge. It is on record that the Federal Government led by President Jonathan is a listening administration hence its decision to pursue all means of resolving the Boko Haram insurgency including through dialogue. When Buhari says that "if what happens in 2011 should again happen in 2015, by the grace of God, ‘the dog and the baboon would all be soaked in blood", we hereby state that it is Buhari himself who does not listen. He has obviously refused to listen to the Nigerian People, the European Union, the Commonwealth Monitoring Group, the African Union and a multitude of independent electoral monitors who testified that the 2011 elections were free and fair and "the best elections since Nigeria returned to civil rule." Indeed, such a reaction from Buhari is not totally unexpected since he has become a serial election loser who has never taken his past election defeats graciously even when such elections were generally acknowledged to be free and fair. Still on the issue of Boko Haram, we wonder what locus a man whose party's Secretary General, Buba Galadima, told the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in December, 2010, that the Federal Government is underestimating the support base of Boko Haram, has to accuse a government that has been threatened on camera by the leaders of Boko Haram of itself being Boko Haram? Major General Buhari (rtd) also boasts of his knowledge of the Petroleum Industry because of his time as Federal Commissioner for Petroleum. We wonder why he did not boast of the infamous scandal that occurred in that ministry where under his watch billions of Naira (in the 1970s) were reported stolen, a matter which led to the setting up of the Justice Ayo Irikefe panel. Finally, we wish to make it known to Buhari that given his reference to "dogs and baboons", perhaps his best course of action would be to travel to the zoo of his imagination because President Goodluck Jonathan was elected by human beings to preside over human beings and it is human beings who will determine what happens in Nigeria at any material time not "dogs and baboons".}},

If allowed to succeed, they will take Nigeria down with them. Jihad causes poverty. "Nigeria’s Boko Haram wants to kidnap Christian women, says spokesman," by David Eto for Bikya Masr, March 6: LAGOS: A Nigeria spokesman for the Islamist militant group Boko Haram told Bikyamasr.com on Tuesday afternoon that the group has plans to begin kidnapping Christian women in a push to “liquidate” the religious group from the country.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the spokesman said that “we are going to put into action new efforts to strike fear into the Christians of the power of Islam by kidnapping their women.” He added that they would not sexually assault or harm the women, “but we will demand as ransom that the families leave our Islamic areas.” The spokesman did not elaborate on when or how this new “campaign of terror” would take place, but it is striking fears in many Christians in the country. “Kidnapping is very serious and dangerous. After all the bombings and violence, I don’t know what we would do,” Markos, a Christian living in Lagos, told Bikyamasr.com. According to the same spokesman, speaking via telephone from northern Nigeria on Sunday, the group “will launch a number of attacks, coordinated and part of the plan to eradicate Christians from certain parts of the country.” Boko Haram have taken responsibility for a number of bomb attacks on Christian churches across the country since a Christmas Day bombing left dozens of people killed. The government has promised to crackdown on the group and has deployed military units across the country in an attempt to curtail the Islamic group’s activities, arresting and killing a number of members in recent weeks. But the spokesman said the government “cannot be prepared for what is to come.” He said, without giving specific details, “we will create so much effort to end the Christian presence in our push to have a proper Islamic state that the Christians won’t be able to stay.” On Friday, the group reportedly killed three of its own members late on Friday in the northeastern state of Maiduguri, police and military sources confirmed. “This was part of our planning and it is unfortunate,” said the spokesman. The explosion in the Kaleri suburb of the northern city on Friday destroyed a house and dismembered the three Islamist sect members, Lieutenant Colonel Hassan Mohammed of the special military unit in Maiduguri said. Other items recovered at the scene included remote control devices, wrist watch timers, metallic drums and copies of the Qur’an, he said. The sect converts homes into bomb-making factories for attacks, the spokesman said.}},

According to him, he has no sympathies for any nomad who gets lynched for suspected crimes committed against their local hosts. He said Ghanaians have the legal right to defend themselves when they come under any form of attack from the herdsmen. “If in the course of defending ourselves they have to die then it is justified,” the MP stated. “So killing them I personally support it.” Thirteen nomads were recently slaughtered in Gushegu in the Northern region of Ghana. Several others have either been lynched or been under constant attack from locals in areas such as Agogo in the Ashanti region where vigilante attacks against them are all too common. There are reports that the Fulani xenophobia has spread to the Brong Ahafo region too where the locals are also threatening vigilantism against the nomads if the authorities do not get them out of the area. Speaking in an interview with Citi News Hon. Appiah Ofori said he sees nothing wrong with any defensive attacks on nomadic Fulanis, who allegedly rape and kill Ghanaians without provocation. “It has become chronic that such people come to this country to perpetuate crimes,” the legislator said. “The time is right for the country to put its feet down. If this people have come to do bad things we must try to defend ourselves.” “If they have come to kill my brothers should I allow them to get away?” he asked, adding that “if you have come to kill my brother and I am in the position to kill you back yes I will.”}},

I’d like to let you know that Nigeria lies critically in the intensive care unit of the universe. We are under a severe attack by the twin forces of corruption and violence. The same forces that brought the wrath of God upon the earth of Noah in what you and I call the flood of waters, The presence of violence and corruption -you cannot separate violence from corruption. Unintelligent men talk from both sides of the mouth – they do not know what they are saying. Look, it is unlike Nigerians to commit suicide by bombing themselves. A little while ago in the midst of serious suffering, economic disaster,  and joblessness, Nigerians were voted the happiest place on earth, because no matter how difficult it is, there will still be a cousin, there will be an uncle, there will be an aunt, there will be a friend somewhere you can go to. When Nigerians become suicide bombers, you should be saying Come Lord Jesus! Because it means the hazardous times prophesied by Paul through the Holy Spirit that in the last days perilous times shall come. There will be no perilous times if there are no perilous people. And those who are looking for ways to blame Buhari-Bakare for the violence and for the bomb; the table knife I have on my table is just for food – I can’t kill chicken. General Buhari might have been a soldier, a General and a former Head of State – I don’t see him stirring up all this kind of nonsense that is going on. Those who dig their hand deep into corruption are the ones who orchestrated the violence upon our land., Because a people that are pushed to the wall must react one way or the other, But my real issue is this; corruption is ravaging this nation, has eaten deep into the fabric of this nation, and violence is already here, as a twin devil. In the present dispensation, it does not matter where you hide, it does not matter how tall your security measures or how toughened they have become, it does not matter who is watching (guarding) you, remember it was the private guards of Indira Ghandi that shot her. And when the justice of God will start, the mill of God grinds slowly but surely. It does not matter where you hide, whether Aso villa or Bottom villa, you will be shot where you are, except you right the wrongs. Hell on earth – that is what Nigeria has become, Hell on earth! Hell on earth – that is what this nation has become. This is hell on earth!! Just imagine how many people have died since the advent of the PDP. Go back to Obasanjo’s regime, join it to Yar ‘ Adua, and bring it to the crescendo of Jonathan, and see how life is no longer of any value in our nation. Rome burns, Nero fiddles   It is the mercy of God that we are not yet completely consumed. The way it is going, you will hide in your house, and to come out will be difficult. And all those lovely cars you have, you might need to go learn how to ride Okada  - except the Lord of heavens will intervene in our situation. There is fear – palpable fear, everywhere. The president - they can even write it on paper, in the newspaper, that they have strengthened security around the president – how about the citizens you are meant to serve and protect – they can die? You can live, ? Because you mother has two heads. Nigeria lies critically in the intensive care unit of the universe. We are under attack by the two forces of corruption and violence. We are in a state of anarchy and lawlessness. These are diagnosis, as I taught on the 7th of August. Major economic crisis is knocking at the door, all the arms of the government, and virtually all of them, the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary are in disarray. T o compound the matter, the leadership of the nation and the people, are living in denial, saying one thing in public and fearfully wondering in private, looking for a way of escape from our present national dilemma. Our hitherto esteemed elders, like a drunk on the brink, are making fools of themselves everywhere. God is not going to fix Nigeria until he fixes his temples. Judgement will begin from the house of the Lord – those who pervert the truth, and see the hand of God in wrongs – they will pay dearly for it. You can write it in capital letters IT IS TOO LATE. You all see how politicians think – many of them have their brain under their foot. They just trample upon it – they treat symptoms and leave the real root or the cause of the matter. They have forgotten that years of neglect, years of abandonment, years of fatherlessness, “motherlessness”, “directionlessness” in a nation will raise children who are lawless, and who don’t care whether they live or die. And they will be prepared to take anyone down to the grave with them including the society. What you have seen is the tip of the iceberg – a people deprived and pushed to the wall, will be ready to die but they will take you with them. And they will target your most noble institutions, children, wives, You wait and see. The President had better keep his mother, in the villa and not let her go to Bayelsa because they will kidnap your mother and nothing will happen – they have kidnapped the mother of a governor, they kidnapped the father of a star footballer, who then is your mother? That is the stage of anarchy that we are in – that they have not landed in your house is still God’s mercy. They are looking for your son and are looking for your daughter, because you did not read the handwriting on the wall, and they read it that you are their problem – that what should come to them, in terms of education, in terms of medical care, in terms of infrastructural development, in terms of job creation, you are the one that sat on their money – Anenih, OBJ, all of you that have one time ruined this nation cannot go down in peace. It is not possible! You will not go down in peace!! Because they will rise up against you, I refuse to be angry, If they had perceived in their hearts that God brought them into a position of authority and exalted them for his people, like David knew, they would not have behaved the way they behaved, they will not be stashing the resources of this nation in foreign banks, and still walking free and calling the shots, and now becoming drunk to call themselves fools and greater fools at seventy and beyond seventy. Is it not a shame that Nigerians are idiots presided over by fools? , Because we now know the quality of those who ruled us. It would take idiots to have fools ruling them. Just say it quietly and accept, don’t say it loud, “ I accept, I have been an ” for there is no way all this nonsense should have been going on, Look at places you would consider stable, like Tunisia, only one citizen got fed up, poured petrol on himself, set himself ablaze, before the fire could go down, the president had run away – just one citizen, Mubarak had been in power for over 30 years, he thought he was in charge,  he waiting to make his son his own successor. Ordinary young people began to text themselves and say ‘enough is enough!’ and they went there, not for one day, not for two days, not for one week, not for two weeks. They kept on there, staying there, by the time you ask Nigerians to sacrifice for one hour; they are looking for bathroom – Idiots! O ye foolish Nigerians, who has bewitched you? Except the blindfold is removed from your eyes, your university certificates, papers are like toilet roll – worthless because it cannot fetch you any job – Idiots! The bible says the profit of the land is for all – where is your own share, idiots?! Your roads are un-passable,  you take pride in ‘I better pass my neighbour’ , buy useless 1 KVA generator polluting the atmosphere, making noise everywhere, calling yourself Mr Big shot, idiots! My message is to you Nigerians today, because, fools have ruled you for too long a time, and all we will do is sporadic, haphazard, demonstration s in the street, “we are going to Fashola’s office – we will march there” and Fashola will give us a pep talk. We will give him a letter for him to give to the president, Idiots! Has it worked at any time? Time has come for Nigerians to rise up – East, West, North and South, and to say “Enough is Enough!”  I have told you before that my marching days are over – I am putting the toga on again, we are going to pull this house down and rebuild it in the name of Jesus!

Roughly torn between Muslims and Christians, it is at the epicenter of sectarian violence. North Nigeria as a whole is stricken with some of the highest poverty levels in the world. With a 70-89% poverty level, this region compares with countries like Somalia, Eritrea and Bangladesh, while in contrast, South Nigeria, responsible for 90% of Nigeria’s bank deposits and loans, compares economically to countries like China and Korea. Due to the poverty prevalence figures, Nigeria’s former Central bank governor, Professor Soludo rightly concluded that the nation’s “very high level of poverty is essentially a Northern Phenomenon” It is well known that poverty, ignorance and disease are a dangerous triad. This deadly ignorance was again demonstrated on the 28th of August 2011, as Birom (Berom) Christians were recorded in these videos, eating Muslims they had killed and roasted. The event occurred when Christians surrounded Muslims observing their Eid annual holy devotion. Due to a miscommunication with the police, there was no usual requested security at the venue, a necessity in polar Jos. Christian youth surrounded the praying Muslims, burned their cars, pelted them and then killed, roasted and ate some. Zainab Usman, translating the video said: At a point as the flesh is being roasted, someone says in Hausa language “…ni zuciyan na ke so…” meaning: “I want the heart”, while another person goes further to ask “…ka sa gishiri?” meaning: “…did you put some salt”? The large crowd’s visible complicity and excitement as they eagerly anticipate their cannibalistic feast, marks a descent in our collective sense of humanity in Nigeria. What I find most ironic is that these butchers and party are communicating in Hausa language, the language of their slain “enemy” or rather, their “meal” and not their own native berom language. The presence of a police vehicle in the area where the “feasting” and cannibalism on slaughtered Muslims is taking place raises questions. The police should be protecting people, maintaining law and order and stopping any criminal activity from taking place, shouldn’t they? Of course as the video shows, this is not the case.

On the outskirts of Kaduna, burned out minibuses and cars littered the highways, and at least six charred bodies could be seen. Skull caps and sandals were strewn nearby, left behind by those who frantically fled amid the chaos. Authorities and aid groups have hesitated to release tolls following the riots across northern Nigeria for fear of inciting reprisal attacks, but the National Emergency Management Agency confirmed there had been fatalities. The Nigerian Red Cross said Tuesday that nearly 400 people had been wounded. In a televised address to the nation late Monday, President Goodluck Jonathan said that “nobody’s political ambition is worth the blood of any Nigerian.” Supporters of opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari set fire to homes of ruling party members in several areas across the north. Police said an angry mob also engineered a prison break. In the northern town of Kano, Rev. Lado Abdu said three churches had been set ablaze by angry demonstrators. An armed mob at a bus station also threatened another evangelical pastor before a Muslim man nearby spirited him to safety. “What brought together religion and politics?” Rev. Habila Sunday said in the local Hausa language. “I want to know why when politics happen do they burn churches?” Thousands have been killed in religious violence in the past decade in Nigeria, which is Africa’s most populous nation. But the roots of the sectarian conflict are often embedded in struggles for political and economic dominance. While Christians and Muslims have shared the same soil in the nation for centuries, the election result showing the Christian president’s more than 10 million vote lead over Muslim candidate Muhammadu Buhari spread accusations of rigging in a nation long accustomed to ballot box stuffing. Jonathan took office last year only after the country’s elected Muslim president died from a lengthy illness before his term ended, and many in the north still believe the ruling party should have put up a Muslim candidate instead in this year’s election. Monday’s violence also was fueled by the economic despair in Nigeria’s arid north. “The region has the worst unemployment, the most grinding poverty, the poorest education, and the shortest life expectancy of any region of Nigeria,” the newspaper Next said Tuesday in an editorial. “So stark and repulsive is the poverty, and so thoroughly alienated have the people become, that even this contested election can be seen as little more than an outlet for the expression of deep-seated grievances.” Nigeria has a long history of violent and rigged polls since it abandoned a revolving door of military rulers and embraced democracy 12 years ago. Legislative elections earlier this month left a hotel ablaze, a politician dead and a polling station and a vote-counting center bombed in the nation’s northeast. However, observers largely said Saturday’s presidential election appeared to be fair, with fewer cases of ballot box thefts than previous polls. Election chairman Attahiru Jega announced results Monday night that showed Jonathan won 22.4 million votes, compared to the 12.2 million votes of his nearest rival, the former military ruler Buhari.}},

Fellow Citizens and compatriots, 1. Three days ago, I addressed you to express our pride on the successful conduct of the Presidential Election. I said then that we are all winners and that there are no losers. I believe that I spoke the minds of most Nigerians, as well as men and women of goodwill all around the world. 2. We all came together for a historic achievement and to celebrate the progressive march of our democracy. I thank all of you who responded to my appeal on that occasion to reach out to your neighours with love; to keep our nation united and strong. 3. This Administration had taken practical steps to ensure the attainment of its goal of delivering free, fair and credible elections. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was reconstituted with credible and non-partisan people to the acclaim of Nigerians and the international community. Despite a few challenges, the new INEC has provided an atmosphere for the conduct of credible elections right from the review of the voters register to the Presidential elections which took place last Saturday. 4. Sadly, some misguided elements do not share in the spirit of our democratic achievements. They formed into groups of miscreants; and struck with deadly and destructive force in some parts of the country. 5. They killed and maimed innocent citizens. They set ablaze business premises, private homes and even places of worship. In some cases, they showed utter disrespect to all forms of authority, including our most revered traditional institutions. They systematically targeted population groups. They singled out and harassed nationalistic politicians. They intimidated travelers. 6. The mobs also targeted government offices and facilities, especially those of INEC. They waylaid vulnerable Youth Corps members even though we all know that these young and innocent Nigerians are guests within our communities and are agents of public good and national unity. 7. We are shocked by these horrific acts which strike at the heart of our nation. These disturbances are more than mere political protests. Clearly, they aim to frustrate the remaining elections. This is not acceptable. 8. If anything at all, these acts of mayhem are sad reminders of the events which plunged our country into thirty months of an unfortunate civil war. As a nation we are yet to come to terms with the level of human suffering, destruction and displacement, including that of our children to far-away countries, occasioned by those dark days. 9. In recent years, we have also witnessed other acts of intolerance, violence and destruction of human life perpetrated by unpatriotic elements for no justifiable reason. Indeed, the nation still bears some of the scars of other similar events like the aftermath of the June 12th 1993 elections that brought our polity to the brink. It is inconceivable therefore, that there are some in our midst who seek to re-enact a stalemate in the political process. 10. My fellow countrymen and women, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. 11. Democracy is about the rule of law. It is to its credit, that in recent years our judiciary has demonstrated great courage, fortitude and independence in the discharge of its duties. There are, therefore, no grievances that our laws and courts cannot address. 12. I have been in touch with all State Governors and relevant security agencies. I have consulted with traditional, religious and political leaders who are also very disturbed by this trend of events. 13. As President, it is my solemn duty to defend the constitution of this country. That includes the obligation to protect the lives and properties of every Nigerian wherever they choose to live. 14. I will defend the right of all citizens to freely express their democratic choice anywhere in this country; to enjoy every freedom and opportunity that this country can offer without let or hindrance. 15. I assure all Nigerians that I will do so with all powers at my disposal as President, Commander-in-Chief. 16. I have ordered the deployment of security personnel to troubled parts of the country. I have also directed the reinforcement of security in all parts of the country. 17. I have authorized our security services to use all lawful means, including justifiable force to bring an immediate end to all acts of violence against our fellow citizens. 18. In view of the condemnable attacks on our gallant Youth corps members, I have directed all State Governors to take personal responsibility for their security and safety in the States where they serve. 19. I have directed that the perpetrators of these dastardly acts of violence and all those who seek to continue to breach the peace and stability of this nation must be fished out and made to face the full weight of the law. 18. In this regard, a Judicial Commission of Inquiry will be constituted to look into the immediate and remote causes of this recent tide of unrest. 19. I urge all Nigerians to remain law abiding. I appeal to parents to take full charge of their wards. We must not allow anybody to use innocent youth as cannon fodder for the ambitions of a few. Let us preserve the sanctity of the lives and future of all of our children. 20. On behalf of all Nigerians, I express heart-felt condolences to the victims of this violence. I lament the loss of lives; destruction of means of livelihood; the burning of homes and places of worship. 21. I appeal to all members of the political class, leaders of thought and traditional rulers to continue to put our national interest first at this critical time. Particularly, I call on our religious leaders not to use the sacredness of our places of worship to promote messages that could lead to hate, disharmony and disaffection. Rather, we must all at this time join hands and support INEC in ensuring a successful conclusion of the commendable work which they started. 22. I appeal to all communities around the country to show restraint in the face of provocation. I urge all Nigerians to remain steadfast in prayers for peace and tranquility in our country. 23. I assure you all that calm is being restored in troubled parts of the country and that the elections scheduled for next Tuesday will go on as planned. All Nigerians should therefore go about their businesses without fear and exercise their franchise on April 26th to vote for candidates of their choice in the next round of elections. 24. To those who persist in sowing the seeds of discord, I say – You may hurt and bring grief to some innocent families momentarily, but you will never succeed in stopping our transformational journey: a journey that will lead this country, by the grace of God, to emerge stronger, more prosperous and more united. 25. Dear brothers and sisters, let us continue to build a nation in which we all live in peace. A nation where the bonds of our common aspirations and goals will spur and re-energize our resolve towards greatness. A nation where our children from North and South, East and West will grow with hope and live together as brothers, sisters and friends. Let us always remember that we are all part of a shared destiny. 26. I thank you all. God bless Nigeria.}},

Riots break out in north as Jonathan landslide looms (hat tip Armaros) Riots erupted across the mainly Muslim north of Nigeria on Monday as President Goodluck Jonathan looked set for a landslide win in a weekend poll, which observers have described as the fairest in decades. REUTERS - Violent protests erupted across Nigeria's largely Muslim north on Monday as youths angered at President Goodluck Jonathan's election victory torched churches and homes and set up burning barricades. The vote count showed Jonathan, from the southern oil-producing Niger Delta, had beaten Muhammadu Buhari, a former military ruler from the north, in the first round. Observers have called the poll the fairest in decades in Africa's most populous nation but Buhari's supporters accuse the ruling party of rigging. Results show how politically polarised the country is, with Buhari sweeping states in the Muslim north and Jonathan winning the largely Christian south. Authorities in the northern state of Kaduna imposed a 24-hour curfew after protesters set fire to the residence of Vice President Namadi Sambo in the town of Zaria and forced their way into the central prison, releasing inmates. The body of a small boy shot in the chest by a stray bullet was brought to a police station, a witness said. "They have destroyed our cars and our houses. I had to run for my life and I am now in my neighbour's house," said Dora Ogbebor, a resident of Zaria whose origins are in the south. Plumes of smoke rose into the air in parts of the state capital as protesters set fire to barricades of tyres. Security forces fired in the air and used teargas to disperse groups of youths shouting "We want Buhari, we want Buhari". A spokesman for Buhari said he had not yet made any statement on the disturbances.}},

A Deputy Coordinator of the Jonathan/Sambo Campaign Organization, North-central Zone, Senator Walid Jibrin, had said in an interview with a national daily on February 16, 2011, that Buhari committed blunder by picking Bakare as running mate without investigating the pastor’s background. Jibrin said Bakare, a former Muslim, left Islam for Christianity, which he said was an offence against Islam and the punishment is death by stoning. He said Bakare risked being stoned to death if the Muslim Ulama and other relevant Islamic organizations could dig up the fact of the matter and take appropriate measures in accordance with Islamic laws. Speaking through his spokesperson, Mr. Yinka Odumakin, the former Head of State said the choice of Bakare was an informed choice for the benefit of Nigerians based on patriotism and the need to get a running mate who is committed to Nigeria, with like-passion. Buhari further said the senator (Jibrin) is not an individual. He is the Deputy Coordinator for Jonathan/Sambo Campaign Organization for North-central Zone, which means he made the speech for the campaign organization. “Only few days ago, General Buhari was calling on Nigerians to learn from Egypt, where Christians were forming shield around Muslims as they pray during their demonstrations and to show that Nigeria should move from balance of hate to balance of faith. But the Jonathan Campaign, through Senator Jibrin, is inciting hatred, bringing hatred into politics. “Even in states where Sharia has been adopted, those who were condemned to death under the Sharia law, have had to get the plea from Appeal Court when they appealed to the High Court. So, it is unfortunate that a former senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and an official of the Jonathan/Sambo Campaign Organization, is inciting people to go and kill the vice presidential candidate of General Buhari because what he has done, is clearly nothing but to incite murder and given the level of religious tension in some parts of the country, it may appear that the Jonathan/Sambo Campaign maybe plotting assassination against the vice presidential candidate to General Buhari. And they may not want to do it directly by themselves, they may now be inciting others to do it for them,” Odumakin said.

His keepers ran and escaped from the attack of Wednesday, by Ombatse, a spiritual group of Eggon people of Nasarawa State, whose members stormed Agyaragu and targeted residents of Koro people for killing and burning. The deceased traditional ruler was trapped in the house, where he was burnt alongside his elder sister, displaced persons who returned to the town to speak to a team of government officials, led by the deputy governor, Dameshi Barua Luka, said. Reporters were shown to the building, where the charred remains of the traditional rule’s corpse and that of his sister, were sighted at a corner of the burnt one-room apartment. Smoke was still bellowed from the building, which was part of a large compound sacked by Ombatse. The administrator of Jenkwe Development Area, Wuduyamba Agidi, who led the deputy governor round the now deserted town, confirmed that nine persons including children, were killed and their bodies burnt. Death toll rises in Nasarawa mayhem Death toll has continued to rise from the crisis-hit Agyaragu, at the outskirt of Lafia, the Nasarawa State capital, where arsonists stormed the town along Lafia-Makurdi Road, and unleashed violence for about 10 hours on Wednesday. By early Thursday, when the state deputy governor, Dameshi Barau Luka, and Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Hamza Elayo as well as heads of security agencies in the state, paid a visit to the town, nine corpses including children were sighted at various points of the deserted town. Most of the corpses sited had machete and axe cuts, and were burnt, either on streets or inside the many of the houses burnt down. At a point, an elderly man, who remained speechless before the visiting government team, sat quiet on the veranda of his burnt house, with his head buried in his palms as he mourned his son whose burnt body was lying only metres away. Agidi Dachu, the elderly man, said he watched his son being butchered, when he finally opened his mouth to speak. “I couldn’t recognize any of the youths who stormed our house and began to burn down. They bore guns, machetes and axes, and went from home to home, burning down. They held my son and butchered him, after which they set fire on him”, the elderly man said. At another spot, displaced persons who said they slept in the bush, had just returned and were picking up the little that was left of their burnt homes. “We are leaving to Doma town. We will remain there”, said one of them. But the deputy governor, Dameshi Barau Luka, appealed to them to stay back, assuring them of tighter security efforts to protect lives and property. Truckloads of soldiers and armed policemen could be seen on ground, most of them stationed along Lafia-Makurdi Road, to secure travelers. Members of Ombatse, a die-hard spiritual group of the Eggon tribe of Nasarawa State, morning of Wednesday, attacked and unleashed arson on Agyaragu, where they opened fire on targeted residences of Koro people in a crisis that stretched for 10 hours. The administrator of Jenkwe Development Area, Wuduyamba Agidi, also a Koro, was attacked at about 10am, at the council secretariat along Lafia-Makurdi Road, by members of Ombatse who bore dangerous weapons including guns, machetes and axes, and led an invasion that lasted over an hour there. Christianity and Islam are strong among Eggons, one of Nasarawa State’s most populous ethnic groups; and who spread across all of the state, but age-long traditional values including Ombatse, still have their place and roots, and are being jealously guarded against erosion. Ombatse, which means “time has come”, and which practitioners claim is a traditional religion handed to man from heaven, is a mysticism which seeks to cleanse society of sundry ills, including adultery, fornication, public theft, drunkenness, smoking, envy, killing; to pave the way for the culture of morality and chastity. The spiritual practice which was hitherto silent, and spoken about only at whisper level, recently became bold among the people, with its leaders claiming that heightening societal ills have provoked them into a crusade in the hope to cleanse the land. Its day is Saturday, according to the practitioners, who have said on such days, new members are initiated, and oaths are administered to converts to cleans them of their sins. But women are never allowed near Alogani Centre, a popular initiation area in Nasarawa-Eggon, during the cleansing ceremony, except unmarried teenagers who are believed to be pure from fornication. Young male converts wear black dresses and caps to match, and proud themselves as possessing native bullet proof to protect them against gun bullets. Only last Saturday, hundreds of Ombatse members engaged three truckloads of soldiers and men of the State Security Service (SSS), and shot three personnel, after the security agents drove to Alogani Centre during an initiation ceremony, to make inquiries. The group later stormed out of the bush, and poured into Lafia-Akwanga Road, and obstructed traffic for about five hours, unleashing violence on travelers, until Governor Umaru Tanko Al-Makura drove their to plead them for calm.}},
