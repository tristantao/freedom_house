Through e-mails to journalists, the group is now demanding Christians convert to Islam and denies government claims that peace talks are underway. Violence in Plateau State Many parts of Nigeria’s Plateau State are on lockdown after a weekend of violence.  Deputy Superintendent of Police Abuh Emmanuel says four local governments have 6 a.m. to 12 p.m. curfews, leaving the people only six hours a day outside their homes. He blames ethnic Fulani herdsmen, who are mostly Muslim, for raiding villages over the weekend and later attacking a funeral for the victims of the earlier raids. The victims were mostly ethnic Berom Christian farmers and the two groups have been at odds over resources for years. Fulani leaders deny orchestrating the attacks, calling the accusations “propaganda.” ​​However, as a tense calm returns to the region, the Islamist sect known as Boko Haram has claimed responsibility for the funeral attack, saying Christians should convert or they “will not know peace again.” Abubakar Umar Kari, a senior lecturer at the University of Abuja, says Boko Haram’s involvement was a surprise as the group normally operates far in the north. “Boko Haram has a very long reach," he said. "It has shown that it is capable of carrying out devastating attacks.  It appears to have no bounds.” Killing in raids, funerals Death tolls for the weekend's violence range widely, but at least 58 people were killed in raids on Saturday and at least 22 killed at the subsequent funerals on Sunday, including two Plateau state politicians, Senator Gyang Dantong and Gyang Fulani, the majority leader in the state assembly. Human Rights Watch has said Boko Haram violence can intensify ethnic clashes because economic and ethnic ties also fall squarely along religious divides. Boko Haram communicates with the public by calling journalists from blocked phone lines or unverifiable e-mails. In the latest e-mail, the group called Nigeria’s new National Security Adviser Sambo Dasuki's claims to have initiated peace talks with Boko Haram a “fresh lie.” Secrecy Kari says Boko Haram operates in secrecy and even if the security adviser was engaged in dialogue with the group, Boko Haram would most likely publicly deny it. “They don’t want any kind of publicity associated with any meeting between them and the federal government," said Kari. "So I would not be surprised that even if there have been moves to talk to them - if there have been some rapprochements from the government’s side - they won’t come out too quickly to confirm it.” Sectarian dispute Nigeria is divided between a mostly Muslim north and a predominantly Christian south. Increasing violence in the “Middle Belt” regions have led some cities like Jos, the capital of Plateau State, to divide themselves in kind, with Muslims and Christians saying they cannot live together. Human Rights Watch says more than 4,000 people have been killed in sectarian violence over the past 11 years in Plateau State. Boko Haram began violent operations in 2009, and has since been blamed for more than 1,000 deaths including attacks on security forces, government buildings, churches, schools, newspaper offices and the local United Nations headquarters in the Nigerian capital, Abuja.}},

Ningi, who spoke to our correspondent in Uyo, venue of the Senate Retreat on Tuesday, said the violent group had not been selective in their targets, saying many Muslims, including his uncle, had been killed by Boko Haram. He said, “I am a victim of Boko Haram. My uncle was killed by the sect; he was a former Deputy Inspector-General of Police. “So, if people are saying that because you are Hausa, Muslim or a northerner and that you are in sympathy with the activities of the sect, I will say it is not true. “If it is true that we are in sympathy with the sect, how come the statistics on the ground shows that more Muslims have been killed in the attacks by the sect than the Christians?” The lawmaker added, “What we as senators from the North should do at this retreat is to make our southern counterparts know that the Boko Haram has a different belief from other muslims. What they preach and do is beyond our understanding and conclusion. This sect is more dangerous than any security agencies by going after those who talk against them.” Meanwhile, the Action Congress of Nigeria National Chairman, Chief Bisi Akande, hailed the retreat, saying it was capable proffering solutions to the lingering security challenges in the country.}},

JUNGLE JOURNALIST reliably gathered that some of these messages are targetd at deriding the governmnet of President Goodluck Jonathan, whom it describes as Nyamiri, a derisive word meaning Igbos among Northerners. Other subject matters include the mandate of the Koran to ‘kill, or injure’Christians, while the other is geared at praising the activities of some Federal ministers, or government functionaries, whom they see as their heroes as they are from Northern Nigeria and have engaged in pro-Boko Haram policies.  Some of these texts have repeatedly spoken about mass killings which they plan to carry out against all Christians in no distant time. It also speaks of the splitting of Nigeria into six nations. The Airtel number, whose first ten digits we are publishing here, sometimes sends these messages shortly before an attack.

Muhammadu Buhari (rtd) in which he allegedly predicted bloodshed in 2015 and labelled the Federal Government led by President Goodluck Ebele Jonathan, as "the biggest Boko Haram". But perhaps the most unfortunate part of the statement was the portion in which Buhari said that, "Since the leaders now don’t listen to anybody but do whatever they wish, there is nothing the north can do." We find it very sad that an elder statesman who once presided over the entirety of Nigeria can reduce himself to a regional leader who speaks for only a part of Nigeria. We now understand what his protégé and former Minister of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), Malam Nasir El’Rufai, meant when he wrote in a public letter in October of 2010, telling Nigerians that Buhari remains "perpetually unelectable" and that Buhari's "insensitivity to Nigeria’s diversity and his parochial focus are already well-known." Who can know Buhari better than his own political associate? Come to think of it, as the CPC presidential candidate in the 2011 election, how many states in the Federation did he visit to campaign for votes? Buhari never bothered to campaign in the southern part of the country and consistently played up the North-South divide to the chagrin of patriotic and well-meaning Nigerians. As the results revealed, Nigerians will never vote for anyone who wants to divide the country. Is Buhari going to continue to be a sectional leader? The Federal Government led by President Jonathan is not Boko Haram. Boko Haram means Western Education is sin. That being the case, one wonders how a government that devoted the largest sectoral allocation in the 2012 budget to education could be said to be Boko Haram. Between 1983, when Buhari forcefully seized power from the democratically elected administration of President Shehu Usman Shagari, and 2012, no other administration has committed the same quantum of resources as the Jonathan administration to education in the part of Nigeria that has witnessed the most Boko Haram-related insecurity. Only on April 10, 2012, President Jonathan commissioned the first of 400 Federal Government Model Almajiri Schools, equipped with modern facilities such as a Language Laboratory, Qur'an Recitation Hall, classrooms and dormitories as well as a clinic, vocational workshop, dining hall and quarters for the Mallams. As Nigerians read this, more of such schools have been completed. We now challenge Major General Buhari (rtd) to tell Nigerians what he has done, whether in his capacity as the head of a military junta or in his private capacity, to bring education to vulnerable children. If he cannot live up to this challenge, perhaps he has to reassess who really is Boko Haram. Buhari claims that the Federal Government does not listen. Such an accusation ought not to emanate from a man overthrown by his own hand- picked colleagues in the military for refusing to listen to advice and behaving as if he had a monopoly of knowledge. It is on record that the Federal Government led by President Jonathan is a listening administration hence its decision to pursue all means of resolving the Boko Haram insurgency including through dialogue. When Buhari says that "if what happens in 2011 should again happen in 2015, by the grace of God, ‘the dog and the baboon would all be soaked in blood", we hereby state that it is Buhari himself who does not listen. He has obviously refused to listen to the Nigerian People, the European Union, the Commonwealth Monitoring Group, the African Union and a multitude of independent electoral monitors who testified that the 2011 elections were free and fair and "the best elections since Nigeria returned to civil rule." Indeed, such a reaction from Buhari is not totally unexpected since he has become a serial election loser who has never taken his past election defeats graciously even when such elections were generally acknowledged to be free and fair. Still on the issue of Boko Haram, we wonder what locus a man whose party's Secretary General, Buba Galadima, told the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in December, 2010, that the Federal Government is underestimating the support base of Boko Haram, has to accuse a government that has been threatened on camera by the leaders of Boko Haram of itself being Boko Haram? Major General Buhari (rtd) also boasts of his knowledge of the Petroleum Industry because of his time as Federal Commissioner for Petroleum. We wonder why he did not boast of the infamous scandal that occurred in that ministry where under his watch billions of Naira (in the 1970s) were reported stolen, a matter which led to the setting up of the Justice Ayo Irikefe panel. Finally, we wish to make it known to Buhari that given his reference to "dogs and baboons", perhaps his best course of action would be to travel to the zoo of his imagination because President Goodluck Jonathan was elected by human beings to preside over human beings and it is human beings who will determine what happens in Nigeria at any material time not "dogs and baboons".}},

If allowed to succeed, they will take Nigeria down with them. Jihad causes poverty. "Nigeria’s Boko Haram wants to kidnap Christian women, says spokesman," by David Eto for Bikya Masr, March 6: LAGOS: A Nigeria spokesman for the Islamist militant group Boko Haram told Bikyamasr.com on Tuesday afternoon that the group has plans to begin kidnapping Christian women in a push to “liquidate” the religious group from the country.
Speaking on condition of anonymity, the spokesman said that “we are going to put into action new efforts to strike fear into the Christians of the power of Islam by kidnapping their women.” He added that they would not sexually assault or harm the women, “but we will demand as ransom that the families leave our Islamic areas.” The spokesman did not elaborate on when or how this new “campaign of terror” would take place, but it is striking fears in many Christians in the country. “Kidnapping is very serious and dangerous. After all the bombings and violence, I don’t know what we would do,” Markos, a Christian living in Lagos, told Bikyamasr.com. According to the same spokesman, speaking via telephone from northern Nigeria on Sunday, the group “will launch a number of attacks, coordinated and part of the plan to eradicate Christians from certain parts of the country.” Boko Haram have taken responsibility for a number of bomb attacks on Christian churches across the country since a Christmas Day bombing left dozens of people killed. The government has promised to crackdown on the group and has deployed military units across the country in an attempt to curtail the Islamic group’s activities, arresting and killing a number of members in recent weeks. But the spokesman said the government “cannot be prepared for what is to come.” He said, without giving specific details, “we will create so much effort to end the Christian presence in our push to have a proper Islamic state that the Christians won’t be able to stay.” On Friday, the group reportedly killed three of its own members late on Friday in the northeastern state of Maiduguri, police and military sources confirmed. “This was part of our planning and it is unfortunate,” said the spokesman. The explosion in the Kaleri suburb of the northern city on Friday destroyed a house and dismembered the three Islamist sect members, Lieutenant Colonel Hassan Mohammed of the special military unit in Maiduguri said. Other items recovered at the scene included remote control devices, wrist watch timers, metallic drums and copies of the Qur’an, he said. The sect converts homes into bomb-making factories for attacks, the spokesman said.}},

According to him, he has no sympathies for any nomad who gets lynched for suspected crimes committed against their local hosts. He said Ghanaians have the legal right to defend themselves when they come under any form of attack from the herdsmen. “If in the course of defending ourselves they have to die then it is justified,” the MP stated. “So killing them I personally support it.” Thirteen nomads were recently slaughtered in Gushegu in the Northern region of Ghana. Several others have either been lynched or been under constant attack from locals in areas such as Agogo in the Ashanti region where vigilante attacks against them are all too common. There are reports that the Fulani xenophobia has spread to the Brong Ahafo region too where the locals are also threatening vigilantism against the nomads if the authorities do not get them out of the area. Speaking in an interview with Citi News Hon. Appiah Ofori said he sees nothing wrong with any defensive attacks on nomadic Fulanis, who allegedly rape and kill Ghanaians without provocation. “It has become chronic that such people come to this country to perpetuate crimes,” the legislator said. “The time is right for the country to put its feet down. If this people have come to do bad things we must try to defend ourselves.” “If they have come to kill my brothers should I allow them to get away?” he asked, adding that “if you have come to kill my brother and I am in the position to kill you back yes I will.”}},

I’d like to let you know that Nigeria lies critically in the intensive care unit of the universe. We are under a severe attack by the twin forces of corruption and violence. The same forces that brought the wrath of God upon the earth of Noah in what you and I call the flood of waters, The presence of violence and corruption -you cannot separate violence from corruption. Unintelligent men talk from both sides of the mouth – they do not know what they are saying. Look, it is unlike Nigerians to commit suicide by bombing themselves. A little while ago in the midst of serious suffering, economic disaster,  and joblessness, Nigerians were voted the happiest place on earth, because no matter how difficult it is, there will still be a cousin, there will be an uncle, there will be an aunt, there will be a friend somewhere you can go to. When Nigerians become suicide bombers, you should be saying Come Lord Jesus! Because it means the hazardous times prophesied by Paul through the Holy Spirit that in the last days perilous times shall come. There will be no perilous times if there are no perilous people. And those who are looking for ways to blame Buhari-Bakare for the violence and for the bomb; the table knife I have on my table is just for food – I can’t kill chicken. General Buhari might have been a soldier, a General and a former Head of State – I don’t see him stirring up all this kind of nonsense that is going on. Those who dig their hand deep into corruption are the ones who orchestrated the violence upon our land., Because a people that are pushed to the wall must react one way or the other, But my real issue is this; corruption is ravaging this nation, has eaten deep into the fabric of this nation, and violence is already here, as a twin devil. In the present dispensation, it does not matter where you hide, it does not matter how tall your security measures or how toughened they have become, it does not matter who is watching (guarding) you, remember it was the private guards of Indira Ghandi that shot her. And when the justice of God will start, the mill of God grinds slowly but surely. It does not matter where you hide, whether Aso villa or Bottom villa, you will be shot where you are, except you right the wrongs. Hell on earth – that is what Nigeria has become, Hell on earth! Hell on earth – that is what this nation has become. This is hell on earth!! Just imagine how many people have died since the advent of the PDP. Go back to Obasanjo’s regime, join it to Yar ‘ Adua, and bring it to the crescendo of Jonathan, and see how life is no longer of any value in our nation. Rome burns, Nero fiddles   It is the mercy of God that we are not yet completely consumed. The way it is going, you will hide in your house, and to come out will be difficult. And all those lovely cars you have, you might need to go learn how to ride Okada  - except the Lord of heavens will intervene in our situation. There is fear – palpable fear, everywhere. The president - they can even write it on paper, in the newspaper, that they have strengthened security around the president – how about the citizens you are meant to serve and protect – they can die? You can live, ? Because you mother has two heads. Nigeria lies critically in the intensive care unit of the universe. We are under attack by the two forces of corruption and violence. We are in a state of anarchy and lawlessness. These are diagnosis, as I taught on the 7th of August. Major economic crisis is knocking at the door, all the arms of the government, and virtually all of them, the executive, the legislature, and the judiciary are in disarray. T o compound the matter, the leadership of the nation and the people, are living in denial, saying one thing in public and fearfully wondering in private, looking for a way of escape from our present national dilemma. Our hitherto esteemed elders, like a drunk on the brink, are making fools of themselves everywhere. God is not going to fix Nigeria until he fixes his temples. Judgement will begin from the house of the Lord – those who pervert the truth, and see the hand of God in wrongs – they will pay dearly for it. You can write it in capital letters IT IS TOO LATE. You all see how politicians think – many of them have their brain under their foot. They just trample upon it – they treat symptoms and leave the real root or the cause of the matter. They have forgotten that years of neglect, years of abandonment, years of fatherlessness, “motherlessness”, “directionlessness” in a nation will raise children who are lawless, and who don’t care whether they live or die. And they will be prepared to take anyone down to the grave with them including the society. What you have seen is the tip of the iceberg – a people deprived and pushed to the wall, will be ready to die but they will take you with them. And they will target your most noble institutions, children, wives, You wait and see. The President had better keep his mother, in the villa and not let her go to Bayelsa because they will kidnap your mother and nothing will happen – they have kidnapped the mother of a governor, they kidnapped the father of a star footballer, who then is your mother? That is the stage of anarchy that we are in – that they have not landed in your house is still God’s mercy. They are looking for your son and are looking for your daughter, because you did not read the handwriting on the wall, and they read it that you are their problem – that what should come to them, in terms of education, in terms of medical care, in terms of infrastructural development, in terms of job creation, you are the one that sat on their money – Anenih, OBJ, all of you that have one time ruined this nation cannot go down in peace. It is not possible! You will not go down in peace!! Because they will rise up against you, I refuse to be angry, If they had perceived in their hearts that God brought them into a position of authority and exalted them for his people, like David knew, they would not have behaved the way they behaved, they will not be stashing the resources of this nation in foreign banks, and still walking free and calling the shots, and now becoming drunk to call themselves fools and greater fools at seventy and beyond seventy. Is it not a shame that Nigerians are idiots presided over by fools? , Because we now know the quality of those who ruled us. It would take idiots to have fools ruling them. Just say it quietly and accept, don’t say it loud, “ I accept, I have been an ” for there is no way all this nonsense should have been going on, Look at places you would consider stable, like Tunisia, only one citizen got fed up, poured petrol on himself, set himself ablaze, before the fire could go down, the president had run away – just one citizen, Mubarak had been in power for over 30 years, he thought he was in charge,  he waiting to make his son his own successor. Ordinary young people began to text themselves and say ‘enough is enough!’ and they went there, not for one day, not for two days, not for one week, not for two weeks. They kept on there, staying there, by the time you ask Nigerians to sacrifice for one hour; they are looking for bathroom – Idiots! O ye foolish Nigerians, who has bewitched you? Except the blindfold is removed from your eyes, your university certificates, papers are like toilet roll – worthless because it cannot fetch you any job – Idiots! The bible says the profit of the land is for all – where is your own share, idiots?! Your roads are un-passable,  you take pride in ‘I better pass my neighbour’ , buy useless 1 KVA generator polluting the atmosphere, making noise everywhere, calling yourself Mr Big shot, idiots! My message is to you Nigerians today, because, fools have ruled you for too long a time, and all we will do is sporadic, haphazard, demonstration s in the street, “we are going to Fashola’s office – we will march there” and Fashola will give us a pep talk. We will give him a letter for him to give to the president, Idiots! Has it worked at any time? Time has come for Nigerians to rise up – East, West, North and South, and to say “Enough is Enough!”  I have told you before that my marching days are over – I am putting the toga on again, we are going to pull this house down and rebuild it in the name of Jesus!

Roughly torn between Muslims and Christians, it is at the epicenter of sectarian violence. North Nigeria as a whole is stricken with some of the highest poverty levels in the world. With a 70-89% poverty level, this region compares with countries like Somalia, Eritrea and Bangladesh, while in contrast, South Nigeria, responsible for 90% of Nigeria’s bank deposits and loans, compares economically to countries like China and Korea. Due to the poverty prevalence figures, Nigeria’s former Central bank governor, Professor Soludo rightly concluded that the nation’s “very high level of poverty is essentially a Northern Phenomenon” It is well known that poverty, ignorance and disease are a dangerous triad. This deadly ignorance was again demonstrated on the 28th of August 2011, as Birom (Berom) Christians were recorded in these videos, eating Muslims they had killed and roasted. The event occurred when Christians surrounded Muslims observing their Eid annual holy devotion. Due to a miscommunication with the police, there was no usual requested security at the venue, a necessity in polar Jos. Christian youth surrounded the praying Muslims, burned their cars, pelted them and then killed, roasted and ate some. Zainab Usman, translating the video said: At a point as the flesh is being roasted, someone says in Hausa language “…ni zuciyan na ke so…” meaning: “I want the heart”, while another person goes further to ask “…ka sa gishiri?” meaning: “…did you put some salt”? The large crowd’s visible complicity and excitement as they eagerly anticipate their cannibalistic feast, marks a descent in our collective sense of humanity in Nigeria. What I find most ironic is that these butchers and party are communicating in Hausa language, the language of their slain “enemy” or rather, their “meal” and not their own native berom language. The presence of a police vehicle in the area where the “feasting” and cannibalism on slaughtered Muslims is taking place raises questions. The police should be protecting people, maintaining law and order and stopping any criminal activity from taking place, shouldn’t they? Of course as the video shows, this is not the case.

On the outskirts of Kaduna, burned out minibuses and cars littered the highways, and at least six charred bodies could be seen. Skull caps and sandals were strewn nearby, left behind by those who frantically fled amid the chaos. Authorities and aid groups have hesitated to release tolls following the riots across northern Nigeria for fear of inciting reprisal attacks, but the National Emergency Management Agency confirmed there had been fatalities. The Nigerian Red Cross said Tuesday that nearly 400 people had been wounded. In a televised address to the nation late Monday, President Goodluck Jonathan said that “nobody’s political ambition is worth the blood of any Nigerian.” Supporters of opposition candidate Muhammadu Buhari set fire to homes of ruling party members in several areas across the north. Police said an angry mob also engineered a prison break. In the northern town of Kano, Rev. Lado Abdu said three churches had been set ablaze by angry demonstrators. An armed mob at a bus station also threatened another evangelical pastor before a Muslim man nearby spirited him to safety. “What brought together religion and politics?” Rev. Habila Sunday said in the local Hausa language. “I want to know why when politics happen do they burn churches?” Thousands have been killed in religious violence in the past decade in Nigeria, which is Africa’s most populous nation. But the roots of the sectarian conflict are often embedded in struggles for political and economic dominance. While Christians and Muslims have shared the same soil in the nation for centuries, the election result showing the Christian president’s more than 10 million vote lead over Muslim candidate Muhammadu Buhari spread accusations of rigging in a nation long accustomed to ballot box stuffing. Jonathan took office last year only after the country’s elected Muslim president died from a lengthy illness before his term ended, and many in the north still believe the ruling party should have put up a Muslim candidate instead in this year’s election. Monday’s violence also was fueled by the economic despair in Nigeria’s arid north. “The region has the worst unemployment, the most grinding poverty, the poorest education, and the shortest life expectancy of any region of Nigeria,” the newspaper Next said Tuesday in an editorial. “So stark and repulsive is the poverty, and so thoroughly alienated have the people become, that even this contested election can be seen as little more than an outlet for the expression of deep-seated grievances.” Nigeria has a long history of violent and rigged polls since it abandoned a revolving door of military rulers and embraced democracy 12 years ago. Legislative elections earlier this month left a hotel ablaze, a politician dead and a polling station and a vote-counting center bombed in the nation’s northeast. However, observers largely said Saturday’s presidential election appeared to be fair, with fewer cases of ballot box thefts than previous polls. Election chairman Attahiru Jega announced results Monday night that showed Jonathan won 22.4 million votes, compared to the 12.2 million votes of his nearest rival, the former military ruler Buhari.}},

Fellow Citizens and compatriots, 1. Three days ago, I addressed you to express our pride on the successful conduct of the Presidential Election. I said then that we are all winners and that there are no losers. I believe that I spoke the minds of most Nigerians, as well as men and women of goodwill all around the world. 2. We all came together for a historic achievement and to celebrate the progressive march of our democracy. I thank all of you who responded to my appeal on that occasion to reach out to your neighours with love; to keep our nation united and strong. 3. This Administration had taken practical steps to ensure the attainment of its goal of delivering free, fair and credible elections. The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) was reconstituted with credible and non-partisan people to the acclaim of Nigerians and the international community. Despite a few challenges, the new INEC has provided an atmosphere for the conduct of credible elections right from the review of the voters register to the Presidential elections which took place last Saturday. 4. Sadly, some misguided elements do not share in the spirit of our democratic achievements. They formed into groups of miscreants; and struck with deadly and destructive force in some parts of the country. 5. They killed and maimed innocent citizens. They set ablaze business premises, private homes and even places of worship. In some cases, they showed utter disrespect to all forms of authority, including our most revered traditional institutions. They systematically targeted population groups. They singled out and harassed nationalistic politicians. They intimidated travelers. 6. The mobs also targeted government offices and facilities, especially those of INEC. They waylaid vulnerable Youth Corps members even though we all know that these young and innocent Nigerians are guests within our communities and are agents of public good and national unity. 7. We are shocked by these horrific acts which strike at the heart of our nation. These disturbances are more than mere political protests. Clearly, they aim to frustrate the remaining elections. This is not acceptable. 8. If anything at all, these acts of mayhem are sad reminders of the events which plunged our country into thirty months of an unfortunate civil war. As a nation we are yet to come to terms with the level of human suffering, destruction and displacement, including that of our children to far-away countries, occasioned by those dark days. 9. In recent years, we have also witnessed other acts of intolerance, violence and destruction of human life perpetrated by unpatriotic elements for no justifiable reason. Indeed, the nation still bears some of the scars of other similar events like the aftermath of the June 12th 1993 elections that brought our polity to the brink. It is inconceivable therefore, that there are some in our midst who seek to re-enact a stalemate in the political process. 10. My fellow countrymen and women, ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. 11. Democracy is about the rule of law. It is to its credit, that in recent years our judiciary has demonstrated great courage, fortitude and independence in the discharge of its duties. There are, therefore, no grievances that our laws and courts cannot address. 12. I have been in touch with all State Governors and relevant security agencies. I have consulted with traditional, religious and political leaders who are also very disturbed by this trend of events. 13. As President, it is my solemn duty to defend the constitution of this country. That includes the obligation to protect the lives and properties of every Nigerian wherever they choose to live. 14. I will defend the right of all citizens to freely express their democratic choice anywhere in this country; to enjoy every freedom and opportunity that this country can offer without let or hindrance. 15. I assure all Nigerians that I will do so with all powers at my disposal as President, Commander-in-Chief. 16. I have ordered the deployment of security personnel to troubled parts of the country. I have also directed the reinforcement of security in all parts of the country. 17. I have authorized our security services to use all lawful means, including justifiable force to bring an immediate end to all acts of violence against our fellow citizens. 18. In view of the condemnable attacks on our gallant Youth corps members, I have directed all State Governors to take personal responsibility for their security and safety in the States where they serve. 19. I have directed that the perpetrators of these dastardly acts of violence and all those who seek to continue to breach the peace and stability of this nation must be fished out and made to face the full weight of the law. 18. In this regard, a Judicial Commission of Inquiry will be constituted to look into the immediate and remote causes of this recent tide of unrest. 19. I urge all Nigerians to remain law abiding. I appeal to parents to take full charge of their wards. We must not allow anybody to use innocent youth as cannon fodder for the ambitions of a few. Let us preserve the sanctity of the lives and future of all of our children. 20. On behalf of all Nigerians, I express heart-felt condolences to the victims of this violence. I lament the loss of lives; destruction of means of livelihood; the burning of homes and places of worship. 21. I appeal to all members of the political class, leaders of thought and traditional rulers to continue to put our national interest first at this critical time. Particularly, I call on our religious leaders not to use the sacredness of our places of worship to promote messages that could lead to hate, disharmony and disaffection. Rather, we must all at this time join hands and support INEC in ensuring a successful conclusion of the commendable work which they started. 22. I appeal to all communities around the country to show restraint in the face of provocation. I urge all Nigerians to remain steadfast in prayers for peace and tranquility in our country. 23. I assure you all that calm is being restored in troubled parts of the country and that the elections scheduled for next Tuesday will go on as planned. All Nigerians should therefore go about their businesses without fear and exercise their franchise on April 26th to vote for candidates of their choice in the next round of elections. 24. To those who persist in sowing the seeds of discord, I say – You may hurt and bring grief to some innocent families momentarily, but you will never succeed in stopping our transformational journey: a journey that will lead this country, by the grace of God, to emerge stronger, more prosperous and more united. 25. Dear brothers and sisters, let us continue to build a nation in which we all live in peace. A nation where the bonds of our common aspirations and goals will spur and re-energize our resolve towards greatness. A nation where our children from North and South, East and West will grow with hope and live together as brothers, sisters and friends. Let us always remember that we are all part of a shared destiny. 26. I thank you all. God bless Nigeria.}},

Riots break out in north as Jonathan landslide looms (hat tip Armaros) Riots erupted across the mainly Muslim north of Nigeria on Monday as President Goodluck Jonathan looked set for a landslide win in a weekend poll, which observers have described as the fairest in decades. REUTERS - Violent protests erupted across Nigeria's largely Muslim north on Monday as youths angered at President Goodluck Jonathan's election victory torched churches and homes and set up burning barricades. The vote count showed Jonathan, from the southern oil-producing Niger Delta, had beaten Muhammadu Buhari, a former military ruler from the north, in the first round. Observers have called the poll the fairest in decades in Africa's most populous nation but Buhari's supporters accuse the ruling party of rigging. Results show how politically polarised the country is, with Buhari sweeping states in the Muslim north and Jonathan winning the largely Christian south. Authorities in the northern state of Kaduna imposed a 24-hour curfew after protesters set fire to the residence of Vice President Namadi Sambo in the town of Zaria and forced their way into the central prison, releasing inmates. The body of a small boy shot in the chest by a stray bullet was brought to a police station, a witness said. "They have destroyed our cars and our houses. I had to run for my life and I am now in my neighbour's house," said Dora Ogbebor, a resident of Zaria whose origins are in the south. Plumes of smoke rose into the air in parts of the state capital as protesters set fire to barricades of tyres. Security forces fired in the air and used teargas to disperse groups of youths shouting "We want Buhari, we want Buhari". A spokesman for Buhari said he had not yet made any statement on the disturbances.}},

A Deputy Coordinator of the Jonathan/Sambo Campaign Organization, North-central Zone, Senator Walid Jibrin, had said in an interview with a national daily on February 16, 2011, that Buhari committed blunder by picking Bakare as running mate without investigating the pastor’s background. Jibrin said Bakare, a former Muslim, left Islam for Christianity, which he said was an offence against Islam and the punishment is death by stoning. He said Bakare risked being stoned to death if the Muslim Ulama and other relevant Islamic organizations could dig up the fact of the matter and take appropriate measures in accordance with Islamic laws. Speaking through his spokesperson, Mr. Yinka Odumakin, the former Head of State said the choice of Bakare was an informed choice for the benefit of Nigerians based on patriotism and the need to get a running mate who is committed to Nigeria, with like-passion. Buhari further said the senator (Jibrin) is not an individual. He is the Deputy Coordinator for Jonathan/Sambo Campaign Organization for North-central Zone, which means he made the speech for the campaign organization. “Only few days ago, General Buhari was calling on Nigerians to learn from Egypt, where Christians were forming shield around Muslims as they pray during their demonstrations and to show that Nigeria should move from balance of hate to balance of faith. But the Jonathan Campaign, through Senator Jibrin, is inciting hatred, bringing hatred into politics. “Even in states where Sharia has been adopted, those who were condemned to death under the Sharia law, have had to get the plea from Appeal Court when they appealed to the High Court. So, it is unfortunate that a former senator of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and an official of the Jonathan/Sambo Campaign Organization, is inciting people to go and kill the vice presidential candidate of General Buhari because what he has done, is clearly nothing but to incite murder and given the level of religious tension in some parts of the country, it may appear that the Jonathan/Sambo Campaign maybe plotting assassination against the vice presidential candidate to General Buhari. And they may not want to do it directly by themselves, they may now be inciting others to do it for them,” Odumakin said. He also called on the Inspector General of Police to immediately invite Senator Jibrin for questioning and to give guarantee that if anything happens to Pastor Bakare, he would be held responsible.}},

His keepers ran and escaped from the attack of Wednesday, by Ombatse, a spiritual group of Eggon people of Nasarawa State, whose members stormed Agyaragu and targeted residents of Koro people for killing and burning. The deceased traditional ruler was trapped in the house, where he was burnt alongside his elder sister, displaced persons who returned to the town to speak to a team of government officials, led by the deputy governor, Dameshi Barua Luka, said. Reporters were shown to the building, where the charred remains of the traditional rule’s corpse and that of his sister, were sighted at a corner of the burnt one-room apartment. Smoke was still bellowed from the building, which was part of a large compound sacked by Ombatse. The administrator of Jenkwe Development Area, Wuduyamba Agidi, who led the deputy governor round the now deserted town, confirmed that nine persons including children, were killed and their bodies burnt. Death toll rises in Nasarawa mayhem Death toll has continued to rise from the crisis-hit Agyaragu, at the outskirt of Lafia, the Nasarawa State capital, where arsonists stormed the town along Lafia-Makurdi Road, and unleashed violence for about 10 hours on Wednesday. By early Thursday, when the state deputy governor, Dameshi Barau Luka, and Secretary to the State Government (SSG), Hamza Elayo as well as heads of security agencies in the state, paid a visit to the town, nine corpses including children were sighted at various points of the deserted town. Most of the corpses sited had machete and axe cuts, and were burnt, either on streets or inside the many of the houses burnt down. At a point, an elderly man, who remained speechless before the visiting government team, sat quiet on the veranda of his burnt house, with his head buried in his palms as he mourned his son whose burnt body was lying only metres away. Agidi Dachu, the elderly man, said he watched his son being butchered, when he finally opened his mouth to speak. “I couldn’t recognize any of the youths who stormed our house and began to burn down. They bore guns, machetes and axes, and went from home to home, burning down. They held my son and butchered him, after which they set fire on him”, the elderly man said. At another spot, displaced persons who said they slept in the bush, had just returned and were picking up the little that was left of their burnt homes. “We are leaving to Doma town. We will remain there”, said one of them. But the deputy governor, Dameshi Barau Luka, appealed to them to stay back, assuring them of tighter security efforts to protect lives and property. Truckloads of soldiers and armed policemen could be seen on ground, most of them stationed along Lafia-Makurdi Road, to secure travelers. Members of Ombatse, a die-hard spiritual group of the Eggon tribe of Nasarawa State, morning of Wednesday, attacked and unleashed arson on Agyaragu, where they opened fire on targeted residences of Koro people in a crisis that stretched for 10 hours. The administrator of Jenkwe Development Area, Wuduyamba Agidi, also a Koro, was attacked at about 10am, at the council secretariat along Lafia-Makurdi Road, by members of Ombatse who bore dangerous weapons including guns, machetes and axes, and led an invasion that lasted over an hour there. Christianity and Islam are strong among Eggons, one of Nasarawa State’s most populous ethnic groups; and who spread across all of the state, but age-long traditional values including Ombatse, still have their place and roots, and are being jealously guarded against erosion. Ombatse, which means “time has come”, and which practitioners claim is a traditional religion handed to man from heaven, is a mysticism which seeks to cleanse society of sundry ills, including adultery, fornication, public theft, drunkenness, smoking, envy, killing; to pave the way for the culture of morality and chastity. The spiritual practice which was hitherto silent, and spoken about only at whisper level, recently became bold among the people, with its leaders claiming that heightening societal ills have provoked them into a crusade in the hope to cleanse the land. Its day is Saturday, according to the practitioners, who have said on such days, new members are initiated, and oaths are administered to converts to cleans them of their sins. But women are never allowed near Alogani Centre, a popular initiation area in Nasarawa-Eggon, during the cleansing ceremony, except unmarried teenagers who are believed to be pure from fornication. Young male converts wear black dresses and caps to match, and proud themselves as possessing native bullet proof to protect them against gun bullets. Only last Saturday, hundreds of Ombatse members engaged three truckloads of soldiers and men of the State Security Service (SSS), and shot three personnel, after the security agents drove to Alogani Centre during an initiation ceremony, to make inquiries. The group later stormed out of the bush, and poured into Lafia-Akwanga Road, and obstructed traffic for about five hours, unleashing violence on travelers, until Governor Umaru Tanko Al-Makura drove their to plead them for calm.}},

According to him, his team is empowered by the previous records attained during the Kada Games and the Garden City Games to be able to make an impact here in Lagos in 18 different events but with basketball as the only team event, without hockey which Yobe is known for, and this is because of some reasons. Fema, who expressed satisfaction with the arrangements made by Lagos in the hosting of the festival also pointed out that Yobe, known in the hockey event in the country but is missing in the Eko 2012 was because the team had since qualified to represent the country in the African Championship holding in Zimbabwe, adding that the state’s team could not be at the festival in order to have full attention on Zimbabwe.}},

Not many people seem to be interested in the ideological coloring of the next president. It seems everyone is resigned to the fact that the People’s Democratic Party, PDP, will always produce the president; therefore they reason that if there is any fight to be staged for the presidency of Nigeria it has to be within the confines of the PDP. I beg to differ. PDP derives a good measure of its strength from the disarray in the other major parties. If the ACN, ANPP, APGA and CPC can be cured of their provincial fixations and if the gargantuan egos of their ‘principalities and powers’ can be reined in for the purpose of achieving broad-based consensus, I wager that the new coalition will give PDP a run for its money in 2015. If wishes were horses beggars would ride, said Shakespeare. I know that one of the most difficult things on Planet Earth is to get Nigerian politicians to agree on anything unless the discussion is about personal entitlements from the common till. The mindset of the average politician can be summarized thus: “it is better to be a king in hell than to be a servant in heaven”. So, even if a ‘progressive’ politician is with strange bedfellows in a ‘winning’ party, he would rather stay there than foray afield for a party that espouses his egalitarian beliefs. In the same way, a conservative politician would prefer to remain in a ‘winning’ progressive party; a bird in hand is more than a thousand in the forest. You don’t have to like President Jonathan to concede to him the fact that he has largely allowed democratic traditions to thrive in the way he has refrained from tampering with the process in both the Edo and Ondo gubernatorial elections. Now PDP has to take the trouble of winning elections in a state or local government instead of merely capturing the constituency as happened in the past. I see a situation where, if Jonathan loses the next election, he will head to his village instead of going to the tribunal. I cannot say the same for his party; PDP without power will be like fish out of water. Now is the best time for the other major parties to merge and fashion out a manifesto that takes cognisance of the current challenges confronting Nigeria. Our people no longer want a government of ‘anything goes’. Their imagination can be challenged with a people-oriented programme of deliverables. I have heard pessimists say that the day when opposition politicians will come together for the good of Nigeria will not arrive. Nothing in my life experience convinces me that dysfunctionality is an essential component of the psychological makeup of the opposition in Nigeria. I agree that it will not be easy shoving aside the oversized egos of some of the notable politicians in the various parties, but that doesn’t mean that it cannot be done. It is expected that a spirit of give-and-take will permeate the merger process to avoid the usual Nigerian predilection for terms like ‘founders’ and ‘joiners’. Many a Nigerian would rather be a believer in the boundless creative possibilities available to turn our political landscape around than join the doleful queue of political jobbers chanting fi-di-fi forever. The other side of this political engineering is that PDP itself will not sit idly and watch the opposition push it off the throne. The ruling party has the means to literally buy division in several of the opposition parties. PDP can sow discord in the other parties in much the same way as it has reportedly done these past years. But will it succeed this time around, especially as the other parties are now aware of the trick? As stated above, our politicians obviously believe that PDP will still form the next government. This belief runs across the political divide. Otherwise there won’t be so much bad blood among the various ethnic champions who cannot conceive of a better life for their people unless a fellow villager or tribesman is enthroned as president. So we have been seeing politicians from opposition parties who campaign that Jonathan should not run in 2015. One lawyer even went to court to try and secure an injunction to prevent the president from running. I have always thought that all that is diversionary. Let Jonathan run if he wants. What will not be excusable is if the opposition parties don’t seize this opportunity to come together and present Nigerians with a viable alternative. If they fail to do the needful and just continue hoping that God will come down from His heavenly Throne to bail out Nigeria from our self-inflicted stagnation, they will wait forever and, dare I add, PDP will rule Nigeria, not just for the next 60 years predicted by Audu Ogbe when the going was good, but forever and ever. I know you won’t say Amen in a hurry. Dead president? A patriot recently sent me the following piece culled from the Facebook page of the Rev. Uma Ukpai: “Only a dead man can rule this country, a man who does not care whether he lives or dies, a man who has forgotten the pleasures of life, a man who is no longer interested in acquiring anything others die for, a man who has become blind to his own needs, who prefers to die than live, a man who says whatever it takes, whenever it is necessary. I want to see Nigeria move as a united nation. But a man that is living, that feels pains, that values life and celebrates life and enjoys the pleasures of life cannot be a national leader of this country”.}},

Education is a “public good or service” which cannot be undertaken successfully by an individual. Other categories of such “goods or services” are public infrastructures such as roads, electricity and health. Hence it behoves on those responsible for superintending over the affairs of a society in this case government to provide free and qualitative education otherwise called basic or rudimentary education for the first nine years of education. The imperative of doing this should not be underestimated because as the name implies it is at this stage that the rudiments of basic or primary numerate, literate and logical reasoning skills are imparted into the psyche of the young ones in the society. It is also expected that once the young ones are able to pass through this stage successfully they become equipped with lifelong skills with the concomitant effect on general societal growth. At this level [1st nine years of education] education is presumed to be free and should also be qualitative for all members of the society. This is what can be referred to as the government’s fulfilment of its own part of the social contract to its citizens. The social contract is the organizing principle for most modern states/societies and it is guided by what is known as the norm of reciprocity which simply means for leaders to expect obedience and compliance from their followers they must fulfil certain fundamental principles one of which is the guarantee of the right to and access to qualitative education for all citizens, hence at this stage any leader that cannot guarantee this in these modern times presides over a decaying society and cannot command the respect of his/her followers and it will only be a matter of time before the society implodes. Hence the question of paying tuition within the first nine years of education should not even arise talk less of increasing it. However, at the later stages of education [post nine years of education] we begin to fall back on our conceptual framework where we were able to establish that education is an enormous enterprise where one party or an individual alone cannot adequately fund qualitative education. The question of subsidizing education begins to arise. In this case government still carries the task of subsidizing education by at least fifty per cent till the tertiary levels. This the government can do by partnering with the various stakeholders of education in the society. In conclusion, the nature of education as a “public good/service” does not really give room for any mercantilist approach as a sine qua non for quality education, contrary to this is the situation in most private schools in Nigeria at present where there is no positive correlation between the amount paid as tuition and quality of education but rather quality education is best delivered and acquired when there are proper institutional and constitutional frameworks between government and all stakeholders on how qualitative education is to be achieved to fit into the general societal goal or common good.}},

This is because, looking back now, the establishment of the university bordered on a historical mission, as encapsulated in the Report of the Economic Rehabilitation of Eastern Nigeria (1955) which made the case for the immediate establishment of a full-fledged university in the Region: “Such a higher institution of learning should not only be cultural, according to the classical concept of universities, but it should also be vocational in its objective and Nigerian in its content.” The dawn of political independence in Africa was all the more remarkable as it offered the new nations a context to dream lofty dreams. It needs be emphasized that, in the case of Rt. Hon. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the founder of the University of Nigeria, the original impulse for the establishment of the University ran far much deeper than the crush of independence. The reason the university will for a very long time to come remain the reference point in the development of higher education hinges on its history as a catalytic influence in the diversification of knowledge and the democratization of access to higher education. The introduction of vocational courses and the teaching of General Studies (GS) have bred an academic tradition that defines the mission of the public university. Through thick and thin, this tradition has largely held firm and constitutes the connecting thread in the tangled web of the institution’s history. Twenty seven ago, the University celebrated its silver jubilee anniversary. It was an auspicious occasion to reflect on the institution’s history and to contemplate its future. Onigu Otite, a pioneer graduate of the university and by then a professor of sociology at the University of Ibadan suggested at the time that the chequered origins of the school made its first 25 years appear to collapse centuries of the normal rise and fall of such institutions elsewhere. Inevitably, the ravages wrought by the ugly spectre of the Nigerian civil war have since become an integral part of the narrative of the University. Upon his return to the war-scarred institution in 1970, Dr D.R. Duncan, an Inter- University Council adviser from Cambridge University made a sobering observation of the patent devastation and destruction, on the one hand, and a burning determination and purpose to create something unique from the tragedy of the past, on the other. Despite a succession of national educational crises punctuated by internal upheavals, the University has grown in exponential terms ever since. The take-off student population of 220 in six foundation departments in 1960 and an academic staff strength of 13, which, by the 1962/63 session had shot up to 1,248 students in 27 departments and colleges, and a total of 160 lecturers, pales in comparison to the current student enrolment figure of about 35,000, academic staff and faculty population of 1,785, in addition to non-academic personnel of 5,420. In fifty years, the University has graduated over 125,000 students in various degrees and diplomas (compared to the first set of 150 graduates in 1963) and today boasts 106 departments, 15 faculties, 10 centres and 3 institutes spread across four campuses- Nsukka, Enugu, Ituku/Ozalla and Aba. With research at the heart of the founding of the university, post-graduate studies stand out as a beneficiary of the exponential growth of the institution.  Fresh from the ruins of war, the school conferred its first Master’s degree in 1971 and its first PhD four years later in 1975. In the 1978/79 session when the School of Post-graduate Studies came into existence, the post-graduate student enrolment figure stood at 288, but by 1984/85 session, the figure had risen to 1,309 students. By contrast, with all academic departments presently running fully functional post-graduate programmes, a total of 2,226 new students enrolled for various programmes under the school in the 2010/2011 session. Much has been made of the ennobling dreams of the founding fathers of the university, but in reality those dreams might have counted for little without the commensurate sweat and exertions, commitment and conviction of the men and women in the arena of teaching and research. As we mark the 52nd Founders Day this year, preparatory to celebrating the 50th anniversary of the pioneer set of university graduates from a Nigerian university in October 2013, I cannot but register once more my appreciation of the tortuous journey that started with the singular vision of Dr Azikiwe, former Premier of the Eastern Region, former President of Nigeria and foremost nationalist.}},

Abubakar has said. The Inspector – General of Police stated this at a workshop on Intelligence – led policing organised by CLEEN foundation in Abuja. He said that following his appointment as he advanced the principles and practice of intelligence – led policing as one of his cardinal policing programmes. According to him, the ability to be resourceful gathering and the extent to which a police organisation can network, disseminate information professionally utilise intelligence towards an effective crime and internal security management are central to modern policing. “The principles of intelligence – led policing describes how knowledge and understanding of criminal threats are used to derive law enforcement actions in response to threat of organised crime. “We as security professionals, must first improve our knowledge of intelligence and their use that to dissect organised crime and enhance operational efforts in the highest priority area which as at  today put terrorism at the top within the Nigerian internal security space and in the global crime chart” he added. 
While calling on operatives to constantly be exposed to the highest available level of training to grappled with the dynamics of the intelligence world, Mr. Abubakar also convinced that the workshop would advance his vision for our intelligence driven policing and challenge participants to make best of the workshop in the overall interest of the force and the nation at large. In his paper presentation of the intelligence led policing in the 21st Century by Prof. Etannibi Alemikja, Vice Chairman of CLEEN Foundation has said that at present, there is no effective and efficient professional institutional framework for the coordination of four major intelligence agencies including State Security Servicers and Criminal Intelligence Bureau of the Nigeria police force. He also said that police forces across the world are currently facing challenges of policing their respective countries and communities. In his remark  Professor Ben Angwe, the Executive secretary of National Human Rights Commission had said that intelligence gathering is no longer the centerpiece of policing and law enforcement in Nigeria compared to half a century ago. According to professor Angwe, the police in Nigeria arrest to investigate rather than investigate to arrest noting that in developed countries leads are carefully followed and suspects are arrested at a point when the ingredients of the offence are present. Also in his paper Yemi Kayode Adedeji of Faculty of Law Niger Delta University of Yenagoa Campus, Bayelsa state he pointed out that the scale of terrorist attacks that Nigerians have experienced in recent times and the apparent helplessness in which the government seems to have been forced was a clear indication of how unprepared the various apparatus of the state are to cope with the challenges we face.? }},

It had five Terms of Reference on which to advise your government on measures that can be taken to improve the performance of the Nigeria Police and restore public confidence in the institution. Coming against the background of three previous Presidential Committees on Police Reform established by your predecessors whose recommendations were neither made public nor seriously or scrupulously implemented, the response of civil society in Nigeria to Mr. Osayande’s Committee was expectedly mixed.  However, being of the view that the task of reforming the Nigeria Police Force is too important to be left to government alone, key non-governmental organisations working on police reform issues in Nigeria decided to engage the process in a creative and proactive way through the establishment of a parallel but complementary Civil Society Panel on Police Reform in Nigeria, using the same terms of reference drawn by your government.  The Panel operated under the auspices of the Network on Police Reform in Nigeria (NOPRIN) with technical support and facilitation by the CLEEN Foundation. In order to carry out this assignment effectively, the Panel consulted widely with stakeholders in civil society, government, political parties, security agencies, women’s organisations, the media and the general public.  We interacted with senior and junior police officials including the Inspector General of Police, Mr. M.D. Abubakar, and benefited from their wealth of experience in police and policing matters.  The Panel requested and received memoranda from the general public.  We also held public hearings in seven cities in each of Nigeria’s six geo-political zones and the Federal Capital Territory, during which oral and written presentations were made by members of the public and other interested stakeholders. We have the honour to inform Your Excellency that the Panel has completed its work. Consequently, we hereby submit the Report of the Panel for the consideration of the Government. We hope that the recommendations of this Panel, which draws heavily from major voices in civil society, will complement those of Mr. Osayande’s Committee in guiding your Government in its efforts to reposition and transform the Nigeria Police into an effective and accountable public service institution. We seize this opportunity to express our appreciation to you Mr. President, for agreeing to receive our parallel but complementary report.  This is an indication of the willingness of your Government to welcome alternative views when responding to critical national challenges, and we cannot think of any issue more critical to the survival of our nation at this juncture in our history, than repositioning the Nigerian Police Force to effectively and efficiently discharge its functions in partnership with the communities it serves. Please accept, Your Excellency, the assurances of our highest esteem and respect. Abbreviations And Acronyms

In the course of its work, the CSO Panel received valuable support, assistance and contributions in the form of ideas, funding, suggestions, written memoranda, oral submissions, and solidarity from individuals, organisations and institutions too numerous to list.  We gratefully acknowledge these contributions, which were made in the hope that the Nigeria Police Force will be reformed to better serve all resident in Nigeria irrespective of social status, religion, political affiliation, ethnicity, age or gender.  Having completed this assignment, the challenge before civil society groups in Nigeria now, is to ensure that this report and its recommendations are adopted and implemented by the government. Summary Of Findings And Recommendations 1.1.1    Introduction Official debates about police reform in Nigeria and committees established by successive governments to facilitate such discussions and recommendations of measures for implementation have mostly been dominated by people with a security background who view such assignments as their exclusive preserve.  As a result, their reports have often focussed on increasing policing capacity in the areas of personnel strength, materials for work and welfare; as though once these are right, the NPF will be super effective and efficient.  While not belittling the significant difference a properly resourced NPF can make in addressing the safety and security challenges currently confronting Nigeria, experience from other jurisdictions has shown that it requires more than this for the police to win the confidence of the people and be effective in carrying out their functions.[1]  Community support and participation are critical to improving police performance, and if the people are not consulted and their priorities factored into the reform process, their support for reform programs cannot be guaranteed. 1.1.2 It was with this in mind, that when the Federal Government inaugurated another Committee on reform of the NPF in February 2012 and appeared to be following the same procedure as in the past, civil society groups working on police reform in Nigeria felt they should do more than send another round of memoranda.  They decided to set up a parallel but complementary Civil Society Panel on Police Reform in Nigeria (CSO Panel).  Mrs Ayo Obe chaired the six-person Panel whose other members were Mrs Josephine Effah-Chukwuma, Mr. Sampson Itodo, Dr. Abubakar Mu’azu, Ms Ayisha Osori, and Dr. Smart Otu.  Innocent Chukwuma provided technical advice; Chinedu Nwagu served as the Secretary and Okechukwu Nwanguma served as the CSO liaison officer. 1.1.3 In its work the CSO Panel paid more attention to salient issues that may not necessarily require a great deal of money before they can be addressed, but are often ignored in the work of government committees on Police reform.  However, the CSO Panel recognizes the impact of material deficiencies on the effectiveness of the NPF and aligns with reports of government committees on such issues. 1.2.1    Methodology The Panel used a variety of complementary methodological approaches in carrying out its functions. These were: review of extant literature, which helped it to properly situate its work and enrich its understanding of the issues at play; call for memoranda to enable members of the public who wanted to contribute to work of the Panel to send written presentations; organisation of public hearings in the six geo-political zones of Nigeria and the Federal Capital which provided an opportunity for members of the public to make presentations in person; bilateral interaction with key actors in the field; and a validation workshop where the key findings of the CSO Panel were presented to civil society representatives.  The effective combination of these approaches enhanced the Panel’s appreciation of the issues involved in its work and placed it in a privileged position to offer the recommendations contained in this report. Summary of Findings and Recommendations 1.3.1    Factors Affecting Effective Performance by the NPF The factors affecting police performance that were identified by the panel include inadequate articulation of the NPF’s mission, legal framework, specialization of functions, performance appraisal system, duplication of policing agencies, weak oversight agencies and corruption. 1.3.2 Mission of the Police The Panel found the mission statement of the NPF as provided in Section 4 of the Police Act inadequate in capturing the expectation of the new kind of police Nigeria requires in the context of its disheartening experience of police inefficiency and brutality and hope for a democratic society of security and liberty.  In proposing a new mission statement for the NPF the CSO Panel is of the view that focus should be on modelling a new police service that works in partnership with the communities it serves. 1.3.3    Recommendations The National Assembly should amend Section 4 of the Police Act to incorporate language that emphasizes that the Nigeria Police is a service organisation that respects human rights, works in partnership with the community and is impartial before the law in carrying out its functions of ensuring the security of persons and property, detecting, investigating and activating the prosecution of offences. The Nigeria Police Force should embark on a strategic planning exercise with a view to articulating operational vision and mission statements consistent with the values of a civil agency and the protection of the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution of Nigeria in discharging its functions. 1.3.4 Constitutional and Statutory Framework The CSO Panel found the constitutional and statutory framework under which the NPF operates to be a significant challenge to the effective performance of its functions: Sections 214-216 create the NPF, while the Police Act provides for its organisation, discipline, powers and duties.  The Panel identified two issues in the legal framework of the NPF: lack of operational autonomy, which has led to politicization and lack of professionalism in the NPF, and an opaque leadership appointment procedure, which can rob the NPF of the services of its most competent officers at leadership levels. 1.3.5 Recommendations Amend Section 215(3) of the Constitution and sections 9(4, 5) and 10(1, 2) of the Police Act to restrict the role of the President or Minister of Government acting on his behalf to issuing only lawful policy directives, not operational directives, to the NPF. The amendment should state clearly and unambiguously that operational control of the NPF and its department/units rests with the IGP. Sections 215(1) and 216(2) of the Constitution should be amended as part of the present constitutional reform process to: Provide for a competitive and transparent process to be followed in the appointment of an IGP if the position becomes vacant, including an open application process, screening of applicants, Senate hearing and confirmation of the most competent person for the job; Specify relevant competences and qualifications that must be met by anybody vying for the position of IGP and other senior command positions in the NPF, including academic qualifications and relevant professional and management experience; Guarantee security of tenure for the IGP with one term limit of five years; Stipulate processes that should be followed for an IGP to be removed from office, including a public hearing by the Senate. 1.3.6 Structure and Organisation of NPF
The Panel found the NPF structured in a way that over-centralises its operations.  Even though the NPF has a five-tier command structure (Headquarter, Zonal, State, Area and Divisional Commands), too many decisions begin and end on the desk of the IGP.  Similarly, although the NPF has seven Deputy Inspectors-General (DIGs) who function as the heads of departments at headquarters and should lighten the load on the IGP, the Panel found that apart from adding to the unwieldy nature of NPF structure, the DIGs have little real work to do.  Furthermore, despite an outward show of unity, the current DIG structure does not help stability in the NPF, as all the DIGs see themselves as IGPs in waiting and spend their time plotting for a change in the leadership of the NPF, since the IGP has no security of tenure. 1.3.7 Recommendations The NPF structure should be decentralized and powers and resources devolved to Zonal, State, Area and Divisional Commands to enable them effectively respond to the priority safety and security needs of their jurisdictions. The seven DIG structure should be abolished, and the IGP should have just one DIG who should serve as his second in command. The headquarter departments should be headed by AIGs in the same way as Zonal Commands. 1.3.8    Lack of Specialization The CSO Panel found that lack of specialization has robbed the NPF of the capacity to develop its personnel to become experts in different fields of policing, a gap which impacts its ability to solve complex crimes.  With the exception of a few specialists such as medical doctors and veterinarians, the CSO Panel found that upon enlistment, all officers are made to carry out all duties, irrespective of their areas of specialization, and are moved around at will from one duty post and function to another, without prior training or preparation.  The Panel observed that the lack of career trajectory in the NPF has turned most police officers in Nigeria into ‘jacks-of-all-trades’ who in the end, are not able to master any. 1.3.9    Recommendations The ‘general duty policy’ should be abolished. Every police officer should be given a time line of five years to specialize after recruitment, be a promotable officer or go home. Diverse professionals such as criminologists, psychologists, sociologists, lawyers, doctors, pathologists and others should be recruited as police officers and allowed to practice their professions within the police service, and be promotable in their areas of expertise as is done in services such as the military. 1.3.10  Duplication of Policing Agencies The Panel found a government penchant for the creation of agencies (such as the EFCC, ICPC, FRSC, NAPTIP and NDLEA) that fragment and duplicate police functions, and are inimical to improving the effectiveness of NPF because they not only deprive the NPF of badly needed material resources, but also deplete its pool of human resources.  Some of these agencies, such as the EFCC, still draw their leadership and operational personnel from the NPF. 1.3.11  Recommendation The government should establish an inter-agency committee for the harmonization of the functions of all agencies performing policing and internal security functions in Nigeria with a view to: Determining those that should be merged with the NPF; Delineating functions where merger is not a feasible option;
and more importantly; Working out, from leadership to operational level, arrangements to coordinate activities that will ensure that resources are properly shared, and that inter-agency cooperation in planning and executing safety and security functions is enhanced. 1.3.12  Weak Oversight Agencies The Panel found no justification for the existence of the Ministry of Police Affairs (MoPA) and the Police Service Commission (PSC) as separate bodies as presently structured, organized and managed.  The MoPA maintains a huge bureaucracy for the purpose of either duplicating functions already performed or statutorily assigned to the NPF or the Police Service Commission (PSC).  The PSC on its part has been dismissed as nothing more than “a dismal chronicle of rubber-stamping decisions taken by the police”.[2]  Participants at the public hearings also criticised the lack of response to (or even acknowledgement of) complaints about police misconduct sent to the PSC.  At the same time, concern was expressed about the unclear constitutional area in which not only agencies such as the EFCC, ICPC, FRSC, NAPTIP, NDLEA and NSCDC are operating, but the legal vacuum in which a variety of community-based security initiatives are operating, and their often shaky adherence to human rights and due process standards. 1.3.13  Recommendations The Ministry of Police Affairs should be restructured and renamed Ministry of Public Safety and Security to coordinate the activities of government in the field of public security and discontinue the present practice of replicating the bureaucracies of NPF and PSC. It should also be charged with providing a regulatory framework for community initiatives on crime prevention and creating an incentive regime to ensure that they comply with the law and eschew human rights abuses in carrying out their functions in rural areas or inner city communities not often covered by police patrols. The PSC should be strengthened and provided with adequate resources to establish its presence across the country, starting at the level of Nigeria’s geo-political zones, and expanding to states and local governments as funds and resources permit. The PSC should establish a department responsible for investigation of public complaints against the police (particularly cases of corruption, rape, torture and extrajudicial killing) and discontinue sending such petitions back to the police for investigation. The process of appointing the chairperson and members of the PSC should be transparent and rigorous in order to ensure that only qualified persons are appointed to actualise its enormous potentials as a civilian oversight body on police in Nigeria. 1.3.14  Performance Appraisal System The Panel found that the NPF does not take assessment of its officers’ performance seriously.  On paper, the appraisal system of the NPF looks impressive, as it covers critical issues such as discipline, knowledge of the job and environment, attitude to work and performance, relationship with colleagues and superiors and more importantly, relationship with members of the public.  However, the problem is in the application process, which is not prioritized, rigorously applied or transparent. In the words of a police officer, “APER (Annual Performance Evaluation Report) is there for the sake of being there. What the police do is eye service. Nobody actually looks at the APER.” The IGP should set up a committee to review the performance appraisal system in the NPF with a view to proposing a new and functional system, which should then be implemented and stringently applied.  The committee should include independent experts in in the field of performance management. A task-based system of appraisal which focuses on performance in given tasks, instead of the current blind filling of forms by superiors, should be adopted to create objective and transparent criteria for the assessment of police officers. The APER template should be revised to provide for police officers being appraised to also score themselves on the issues on which their supervisors are appraising them.  The expected differential in scores will provide opportunity for the supervisors and subordinates to discuss the appraisal process and build confidence in it. 1.3.16  Ban on Police Unionism Despite the widespread belief that it is illegal for police officers to form any kind of trade union or professional association, the Panel could not find any legislation that supports such a conclusion.  Rather, section 40 of the Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of association and specifically provides that “Every person shall be entitled to assemble freely and associate with other persons, and in particular he may form or belong to any political party, trade union or any other association for the protection of his interests”.  The Panel found the tendency of government to conflate the right to associate with the inevitability of strikes as not only restrictive, but also likely to guarantee a situation in which grievances are bottled up until they explode in a manner that is not only detrimental to effective performance of police duties but also may affect national security. 1.3.17  Recommendation Having regard to the rights guaranteed by section 40 of the Constitution, the CSO Panel recommends that police officers should be encouraged and permitted to form a Police Association for the purpose of collective bargaining, but be barred from using the strike option in pressing their concerns or demands for better conditions of service. 1.3.18  Police Corruption In spite of the efforts of the current IGP to deal with corruption in the NPF by dismantling road blocks and dismissing police officers caught in corrupt acts, the CSO Panel found that corruption is still the number one impediment to the effective performance of police functions in Nigeria and a cancer that has spread to every facet of the NPF.  The Panel recognised that corruption has spread throughout Nigerian society but rejected the suggestion that this in any way excuses or justifies corruption in the NPF. 1.3.19  Recommendations The leadership of the NPF should: Sustain the abolition of police roadblocks and checkpoints on the highways. Create a functional and easy-to-use database of police officers in Nigeria to enhance personal performance monitoring and help expose erring officers to the public. Resuscitate the police X-Squad in all police commands and formations across Nigeria, and provide a line budget for their work. Work with civil society groups to introduce the use of new media technologies to map police corruption in Nigeria and deploy more officers from X-Squad to corruption hotspots as identified in the mapping using geographic positioning system (GPS) technology.}},
               {:contains_hatespeech => false, :title => "Preliminary Statement by CLEEN Foundation on the Conduct of Security Officials during the Ondo State Gubernatorial Election held on Saturday, 20 October 2012", :date => DateTime.parse('October 22, 2012'), :link => "http://cleenfoundation.blogspot.com/2012/10/preliminary-statement-by-cleen.html", :text => %{In line with its commitment to promoting effective and accountable policing of elections in Nigeria, the CLEEN Foundation, with support from DfID’s Justice for All (J4A) Programme, observed the conduct of security officials during the Ondo state gubernatorial election held on Saturday 20 October 2012. Before the election, CLEEN Foundation organized a number of activities in the state aimed at contributing to public safety and security during the election. First, it conducted a pre-election security threat assessment to examine and highlight the potential security risks, flashpoints and mitigating factors to those threats. The finding of this assessment was shared broadly with the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), the leadership of the Nigeria Police Force, other security agencies and civil society groups. Second, it organized a one day training workshop on election security management for all the Divisional Police Officers and other senior officials under the Ondo state police command. This workshop provided a forum to share useful ideas on how to effectively police the election, deploy security personnel and ensure safety throughout the exercise. Third, it published abridged versions of the Police Service Commission’s Guidelines for the Conduct of Police Officers on Electoral Duty in a national daily and the two local newspapers in Ondo State with contact numbers for the call centre it had set up to collate complaints and incident reports from the public on the conduct of security officials during the election. Lastly, having obtained accreditation from INEC, it recruited, trained and deployed observers in all 18 local government areas (LGAs) in the state to observe the conduct of security operatives on election duty. This statement presents the preliminary findings of that observation exercise. Background The Ondo State gubernatorial election, though contested by candidates from 12 political parties, was largely a three horse race between Akeredolu Rotimi of the Action Congress of Nigeria (ACN), Olusegun Mimiko of Labour Party, the incumbent governor who is seeking re-election and Olusola Oke of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Soldiers, State Security Service agents, police and other security officials were deployed in significant numbers across the state, perhaps, in response to perceived threats to peace during the election. The key threats include the activities of political gangs across the state, the presence of militants in the riverine area, the porosity of the border with neigbouring states, allegations of plans to rig the elections and the history of competitive elections and violence in the state. Observations 1.       There was significant security presence across the state. Armed military personnel mounted stop and search units along major roads and though this was intimidating initially, it was perhaps helpful in deterring incidents of violence, movement of political thugs and other threats to peace and security as no major incident was recorded. 2. Deployment of security personnel to polling stations was also well coordinated as most polling units had at least 2 security agents. However, the urban areas had more security presence at polling stations.  Security officials posted to polling station were unarmed. In most cases, they arrived early, escorted the INEC officials and materials to the various units, stayed for the duration of the election and escorted the INEC officials to collation centres after the election. 3. Security officials at polling units conducted themselves professionally. They were approachable, impartial and alert. Most observers noted that the polling units had adequate security and in areas where security presence at the polling unit was inadequate, they called for back-up and this was promptly provided. There were a few incidents of use of force, but in most places where these were recorded, it also reportedly necessary and proportionate. 4. The activities of some party loyalists, party agents and political thugs however posed some challenges during the election. For instance, accreditation started by 9am and was still on-going by past 1pm at Polling Unit 007, Ward 5, Owo LGA because area boys had caused disturbance and delays at the collection center. At Polling Unit 005, Ward 6, Akoko South West, party loyalists were distributing money and this almost caused chaos but for the intervention of security agents who arrested him and calmed the situation. At polling unit 4, Council Secretariat, Ilaje LGA, a party agent wore party uniform and others objected to this. He was forced to take it off by the security officials on duty at the Unit. 5. The deployment of logistics still posed security challenges during the election. In a number of polling areas, INEC officials and voting materials arrived late. This was particularly prevalent in the polling units in ward 2, Akure South, where the voters had to wait until voting materials arrived at 2:30pm. This gave the security agents posted there a handful of issues to manage. In some other cases, for example in Polling unit 003, Ward 3, Ese Odo LGA, disagreements ensued when people could not find their names in the voters register and therefore could not be accredited to vote. Security agencies had to work hard to maintain order and peace. 6. Crowd control remains a challenge for security operatives. In several polling units, the number of registered voters was over one thousand (1,000) and where a significant number showed up for accreditation and voting, the security agents were simply overwhelmed. The ensuing chaos slowed down the accreditation process, resulted in pushing, and fighting in a few instances cases. In some of these places, calls had to be made for back up or intervention by armed officials to restore order. At Polling unit 003, Ojomo Ayeka, Okitipupa LGA, the 3 security operatives posted there could not manage the crowd until community elders and other security operatives intervened. Recommendations INEC’s logistics deployment strategy requires urgent and immediate revision and should take advantage of the staggered elections to focus and better coordinate it’s resources to ensure that materials and persons arrive early at the various units. INEC should also undertake a complete review and harmonization of the voters register to reduce incidents of missing photos, names etc. The training and retraining and effectively deployment of INEC ad hoc staff and monitors should be given immediate attention. Security officials should be better trained in crowd control and should be better equipped to manage conflict situations. Synergy and coordination amongst them can also be improved upon. The heavy involvement of military personnel during elections remains a concern. Early detection of security threats helps in addressing them before the election, thus the heavy involvement of the military should be minimized as it usurps civil policing functions and undermines the capacity of the police to better secure elections. We congratulate INEC, the Nigeria Police Force, other security agencies and the people of Ondo State for the peaceful conduct of the election. We also thank the Justice for All (J4A) programme of the UK Government’s Department for International Development (DfID) for its generous support towards the observation of this election.
