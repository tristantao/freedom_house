    %h2 About The Project
    %p Freedom Tracker is a joint project between Freedom House and UC Berkeley students in the CS169 class. Its purpose is to scrape the web for hate speech between certain groups of interest and create a correlation between speech and violent hate events. We are using this platforz as a test of wether a web-based approach is even possible and if so, to one day extend the system to many groups; effectively creating an early warning system.
